### Celebrate The New Journal Blog

Actually I have a lots of things want to be recorded today. But sorry for guys, I am too busy this evening. I handled many things before I have time to write here. And now is 2:12 a.m. I will also get up early tomorrow to catch up an airplane for travel.

Yes I have a travel with my girlfriend from tomorrow to Sunday. The destination is Gold Coast. I guess there must be an awesome place for vacation.

For the trip, I spent so much time tonight, and I also won’t bring my computer to there. That means maybe I can not deploy my new journals to Github. So I just want to ask for a leave, hope you guys could forgive me. Sure I also could write journal on my iPhone. There is an amazing app called Day One. It supports all of platforms, and I even spent 128 RMB for getting a Mac version.

I will take lots of photos on my next three journals, it shouldn’t be disappointing for you guys, trust me!

Today I implemented an important work on the plan Road For Revenge. That is I built the static blog for those journals. It should be looked more professional and serious, Might you guys hope so. I took some time tonight on it as well, to change some code on layouts, change some styles for my specific requirements. For now it is simple and enough to myself.

The most difficult part is also what I want to record here to discuss with you. That is how I could make the whole process below easier:

Writing journal on Day One, then copy it and wrap with markdown syntax to the master branch on the repository Road For Revenge. After that, using commend `hexo new post ‘title’` to create a post template in hexo engine, then copy the journal which is markdown version to the post template. Finally deploying the new post to Github Pages for updating the blog.
Furthermore, If there is any issue has been reported, then I have to fix it among those 3 different ways.

This process is holy shit. I don’t have so much time could be used for those insignificant and what things are easy to make mistakes. I have some ideas on program, but sorry guys I don’t have enough time to say it today. If you have any idea please discuss with me, that would be interesting.

See you guys next Monday!
