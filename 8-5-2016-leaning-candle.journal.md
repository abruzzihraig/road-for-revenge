### Leaning Candle
I had a quarrel with my girlfriend just now.

That’s because she leaned the firing scented candle and poured down the candle liquid around inner wall of candle cup. New concreted candle sticked on the wall. She made it bizarre just like a shit.

I don’t know why she always treat me like this, she just feeling good when kidding me. We bought the candle from city tonight, I don’t care about its flavour, I don’t care about how its price. But if it was intact and regular and clear, why she would break it to make me annoyed?

I bore so many things carefully to prevent anyone thought I have an obsessive-compulsive disorder. But I don’t know why there always are someone like my girlfriend want to tease me.
You know something if you did, you can not return it back to regular, just like the bizarre candle. It is ugly and I can’t bear it on my neat desktop. How should I do? Just throw it away? It has more than $30, am I rich man? or can I bear it half year? Fucking damn it!

So I just said to her: get out of here, to find another man who can accept you who always making everything messy then feeling enjoyable.

I hate everyone who made my space messy from I was a child. If someone has used my stuff then didn’t bring it back to original position. The anger would spiral on my brain endlessly.

I have already sacrificed something to make me looked easygoing. I know I still mind those things that anyone break any perfect, regular and clear stuff to messy in front of me. If we need to live together, if we need balance something for each other, why always trying to exceed other’s limit. So if I said something cuss and tried to annoy you, will you feel happy or just going to out of home without any words?

I know that’s my angry words. But I am absolutely annoyed. She felt injuredly then went out. But I still staring at the leaning candle on the desktop, or in my heart.
