### Rush To Clean The Room
I watched the drama Shameless yesterday until 6 a.m. So I woke up late today.

When I opened my eyes, there was already two o’clock. And my friend Ryan asked me in Wechat if he could come here to have a discussion with me for his project.

’Oh! Why you didn’t tell me yesterday!’ I replied frighteningly. That means I need to take more than two hours to clean the room before he comes in.

So that I told him he could come to my home after 4 p.m. Then I started to clean immediately.

I washed the toilet with detergent, but the brush has some oil on it. So I had to flush it many times until there is no oil float on water surface.

After that, I folded my bed against the wall. So that there were more space could make a guest feel spacious.

I also used a vacuum cleaner to clean every corner on the floor. Thanks for its battery, it actually could finish the whole cleaning work with me at this important time.

Took shower, washed dishes, Took out the trash, hide clothes and socks. I even don’t have a lunch during the busy cleaning work. I didn’t eat anything nearly one day(so I was very hungry when I discussed with him).

When the work almost finished, he rang the doorbell. What a hurry process! But at least I did it, that was really made me pleasant.
