### How To Save My Best Friend
Recently I have a little bit depressed about my best friend.

He is the only one I am truly admired when I was in high school. At that time, he was good at anything as long as he was interested. Whether it is study, sport, music or game. He just liked a star which is flashing constantly.

In my mind, I have been expecting someday I could have a company with him, and we could challenge this world for displaying some our personal beliefs.

However, it was ruined by the social reality after we graduated from high school. I got a conflict when I was applying a university, so I dropped down to a mediocre university. I lost passion and belief in there. Because to meet an excellent guy is difficult in there. It just like you cannot make a delicious dish in a cesspit.

I was lost a whole year at the beginning of my university. At the same time, my friend had lost something more important in his life. That is the interest.

He lost interest in any objects in this world. The only one he loved is philosophy, but he was involved into a strange situation is that he cannot find significance from anything. This status made him depressed everyday until now.

He dropped out from his university, and became a totally failure in society.

After I earned more, I pursued him came to Beijing with me, to study to be a programmer. So that finally he could get an interesting job by himself.

But I was totally wrong. I felt disappointed for him. He didn’t have a right attitude to learn. He had an ineffective status on studying programming. He didn’t have any passion on it. Because that is difficult to pursue anyone to breakout their cozy zone.

I argued a few times with him, then I was almost desperate. I am not a lucky guy, I have gone through a series of tragedies. After saw his status I had to think about my future, cause I am not same with him. I don’t have a happy family, I have to away from my hometown to find a place truly fit me.

Although I am not in Beijing, I still feel regret about him. I don’t know how to save him to be a positive guy. I want to pursue him to see a phycologist, but he must be disgusted. After all, he is such a smart guy, he has his pride and no one could ruin it mercilessly.
