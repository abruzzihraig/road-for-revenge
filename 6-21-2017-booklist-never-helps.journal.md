### Booklist Never Helps
I got a request from our test engineer. She wanted a booklist about how to learn Javascript, and I made one for her. I was serious about it, and I even commented on each book that I recommend. I thought that might be useful for our whole development team so I copied one and shared with the team.

But I bet no one would give it a glimpse, even finish looking through the email. Thatâ€™s my Australian workmates. I have enough confidence on their laziness.
