### Hot Night
Tonight is too hot. I cannot focus on anything I wanted to do. The only one thing I did meaningful tonight is that only use less than 20-line code instead of the 2000-line legacy code implemented a live demo for our primary product. I don’t know why these guys wrote so much useless code to implement such a small requirement, plus the 3rd-party libraries, and their legacy code is more than six thousand lines. I believe they had already taken at least three months on it, but why our boss thought that makes sense? It’s funny story, about how to fish in troubled water.
