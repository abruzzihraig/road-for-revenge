### Ng2 Meetup
Sorry about that itâ€™s too late to write now. And I am so sleepy, that means I have to make a brief for today then go bed to sleep.

I attempted the Angular2 celebrating meetup with my friends. But actually, there was no any attractive thingy during the speech. We just got some pizzas and beers as a dinner.

The speech just took us less than half hour, and there were two guys introduced that Angular2 had been released and where can we learn it. The second guy is an Indian. I cannot understand most of words from his mouth. Dude, please forgive me.

So, that is a boring meetup again. Hope someday I could meet a better one, and hope I could speak more smoothly to foreigners then.
