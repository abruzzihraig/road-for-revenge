### Helldivers Come Back
I just turned to play the game Helldivers again. Since the game Magicka2 made my friends and me excited online. So we decided to play the similar best online game Helldivers on PS4 in 2015.

My account has only eight levels, and my friend is totally a newbie. We were fucked by those zergs again and again. Even though sometimes there was a high-level guy could help us out of danger, finally we would pull up his/her socks to make tasks failed. No wonder no one wanted to fight with us more than one battle.

We liked to choose challenging battles, but the high-level enemies always taught us how to be human. We were killed by some giant zergs thousands of times, but we didn’t give up. I don’t mean if we insist on fighting with those powerful enemies more times then we could get a victory. We just never give up, but always keep died.

No matter what, it’s a funny game. We will play it tomorrow.
