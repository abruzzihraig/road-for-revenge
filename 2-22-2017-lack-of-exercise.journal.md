### Lack Of Exercise
I’m not sure if the exercise with Keep in yesterday made me tired. I keep sleepy a whole day even the time haven’t passed 12 p.m. yet. But I am still going to do the same exercise again. Maybe it is also a good way to help me easy to sleep.

In addition, I had an argument with my girlfriend again. I have nothing to explain to her. Totally disappointed by her.
