### Depression On Work
I am depressed since I have known there are some unfriendly colleagues want me quit from the company. Even though I did everything best, and I made so much effort for the company, for the clients, and for the boss.

But some guys still dislike me, because my work is actually made them feel to be pushed. They should have written something bad and shitty like before, then get their money from the clients without any effort. But my way is always different with them. So I feel every day they want to kick me out.

I am insecure about the job, and I am so tired and depressed everyday. I am not happy to write more today. Wish tomorrow I could forget something unhappy.
