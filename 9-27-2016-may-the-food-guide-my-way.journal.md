### May The Food Guide My Way
We would have a plan to exercise tonight. But we totally failed.

After dinner, Ryan’s couple invited me to the gym at their apartment. Cos we all want to become healthy and to lose weight. We three are developers, so we always sit long time when work. It sometimes makes our cervical vertebras painful.

I replied them ‘Yes, I will be there’.

After I arrived to their apartment, they took me to the gym. But all of treadmills were used by others. We looked at each other, then we decide to buy something from the nearby Coles.

I picked some kinds of apples, black plums, half watermelon, bananas, a bunch of kiwis, and a box of Ginger beers. Yep, that’s what I got after the useless fitness.

It seems like I could stay at home more than one week again. May the food guide my way.
