### The Wailing
I watched a brilliant horrible Korea movie at tonight. The movie named The Wailing. It describes a horrible story happened in a small village. It has a long time about 2 and half hours, but even though you watch it seriously until 2 and quarter, you wouldnâ€™t know who is the final murderer.

For figuring out what does the director really wants to tell us, I even took more than 1 hour to read some file reviews. And I have to say it is actually a complicated story. If you want to understand it, you have to learn much of knowledge about religions. No matter what the religion knowledge you know, the movie itself is still worth to watch. If you want to find any horrible but intelligent movie, you could try this one. Korea movie is always best.
