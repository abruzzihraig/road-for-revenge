### Sparkling Water Is Everything
When I was a child, my favourite drink is Coke. Actually any sparkling drink I liked indeed until today.

Since I’ve been living in Melbourne, any drink here is much more expensive than Chinese. Last month I nearly expended more than $100 on them. If I keep it up, I can not afford them.

So this is a time to find another way cheaper and healthier to solve the problem. I did a research among various sparkling water makers on online markets. In general, most of sparkling water makers are same. They don’t need electricity. The only one thing you should do is to install a CO2 gas cylinder on it. And when your cylinder is out, you have to refill it in where supports the exchange service.

After comparing a several of makers, from $100 to $250, finally I decide to buy a normal but not cheapest one [SodaStream Source Element Sparkling Water Maker](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/sodastream-source-element-sparkling-water-maker-red-sodastream/).

It supports the canister could store CO2 60 Litres. That means I could use it produce about 60 Litres sparkling water. Although it has a mixed structure with plastic and nickel-plated material, I suppose it is enough for my requirements. It is firmer than the cheapest plastic version, and it also cheaper than the metal version $100 more. It is a cost-effective stuff. Besides, it is free on shipping!

In the meantime, I have 2 of vouchers that Kogan compensated to me. I used a voucher to reduce $50 to make the bill cheaper to $89, even if to see it as a toy, I don’t feel bad on the price.

Next step for me is just waiting for the delivery.

So let the life more easier, cheers with our sparkling water!
