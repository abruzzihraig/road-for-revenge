### A Normal Busy Day X
I worked overtime tonight to support those outdated browsers. I made some fallback ways for keeping the effect page flipping consistent among all popular browsers.

From tomorrow, I will apply shadow textures on the effect to make it more natural. Ideally post a demo online before I leave should be a good work to me. Hope everything that I will handle is well. Because I donâ€™t know how much time I have spent for handling those browser compatibility issues.

Thanks for my boss to ignore the support of IE8.
