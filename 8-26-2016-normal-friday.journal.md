### Normal Friday
So busy today. For now I am so tired and sleepy, so I donâ€™t have passion to keep a meaningful journal today.

We have tried the angular1.5 with component architecture for our new project. And it works fine for we guys. There just are a few issues about Webpack took us some time actually.

I like the component architecture of Angular2 better than React&Redux. Because the Ng2 gives use more possibility to control some specific rules but it still supports all of essential services for a whole SPA lifecycle. For example, we could use two-way binding on some right situations, we could separate content, style and behaviour to different files. I like that rather than coupling those three parts in one block.

Another thing interesting is our team got a lunch together today. Our boss took us to a Chinese restaurant, which serves delicious snacks from Guangdong. The snacks are really tasty, maybe I should take my girlfriend to eat them tomorrow.

Just a normal Friday, there is nothing need to record, cause I am too tired to write anymore.

Good Night!
