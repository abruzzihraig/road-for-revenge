### Prepare For Leaving
So sad today. Sweet time is always short. I have to say goodbye to my lover tomorrow.

We nearly used a whole day to embrace with each other. We went to a market to bought some snacks for her friends. Most of them are TimTam chocolates, because I heard it is the famous snack in Australia, so we bought them a lot.

After that, we went to the restaurant Rich Papa again. But at this time I decided to choose something new. I used to choose a same food if I tasted it well at the first time. My girlfriend is in another extreme, she always likes to try some new kinds of foods. It has a high risk. So that sometimes she got some foods delicious, sometimes she got a food hard to swallow.

This time, I wanted to follow her. After ordered the food, suddenly my tears were flowed around in my eyes. I love the girl, and I swore I will never separate from her again. If the next time I have to work in another city in this world, she must be followed me everyday. I cannot bear any day I left her.

We packed her baggages in the evening. Even if she was still at home, I was so miss her. We took some photos with Polaroid, and stuck those photos on somewhere I could easily face to. For example, I could see her on the mirror of the wash room, I could see her was brushing her teeth on the picture when I am doing the same thing.

We stuck ten of pictures to different position. In every image she was smiling. At least that will make me comfort.

I love you my dear, let us cherish the last day you will be here.
