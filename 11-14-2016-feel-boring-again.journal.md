### Feel Boring Again
Sorry, it is 3 a.m. again! I delayed the journal because I just want to choose some something simple. I looked through some technical articles and Zhihu topics a whole night. And I just waited for the time flies.

I suppose I will take the negative attitude until the end of this week. That's because the leader is going to travel to the US from the next Monday. So he left some ugly work to me today. I feel utterly disgusted with the code from the work he left. I've never seen code could be such shitty like the work before, but I won't complain about that. Just let them play.

Wish someday I can find some friends are similar to me. Otherwise, I will die from the dull life as ditch-water.
