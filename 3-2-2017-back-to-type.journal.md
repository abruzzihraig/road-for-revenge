### Back To Type
These days I come back to the strongly typed programming language again—the TypeScript. I tried to learn and use it to refactor my previous work, but the main purpose of using that is just a preparation for the coming Angular2/4 that we are going to use.

I’m not sure if which one I would prefer between the languages have strongly type and weakly type. I like both of them, but I do not like using strongly typed language with a kind of complicated ritual sense.

The type checking could help us find more errors or bugs before the code is being compiled, it has huge advantages for a large front-end project. And also, using TypeScript instead of ECMAScript could get more code intelligence from the modern editors. You can easily check function signatures, and find the references to the properties which are exported. That is really helpful when you want to refactor your code.

With type and interface, we could separate tasks more friendly if we are working on the same project. Define an interface and implement it as its shape. Although we only have two guys will work on front-end, it is still an excellent opportunity to learn something new. That is important to us if we want to find another job. I would also need to learn Angular 2 more after the TypeScript.

Keep practice is the best way to master a language.
