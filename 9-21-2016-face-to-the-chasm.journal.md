### Face To The Chasm
I had a fight to the leader again. I should have written something here to record the bad memory. But actually I am depressed and I donâ€™t want to remember anything what happened today. Otherwise, it will recall the bad things again and again then I cannot forget them easily.

The sun will rise tomorrow, and wish I could live one day more.
