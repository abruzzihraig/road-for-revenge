### Fantastic Indie Band Hyukoh
Occasionally, I found a fantastic band which called Hyukoh. It is the first time I totally get involved in a Korean band. The lead Wu He was born in Beijing, and he migrated to Korea when he got into a Korean university.

I have to admit Wu He is a talented musician–during my experiences on listening more than ten thousand hours, I can only find a few musicians can be defined as geniuses, but Wu He must be one of them.

You cannot define which music style the band belongs. Most of the time you can hear out the British smell just like Mumford & Sons, but sometimes you also can find other styles such as Soul, Funk or Pop from it. The band Hyukoh has strongly personal style as a fantastic Indie band. If you want to learn more from it, I would highly recommend its best album ’23’. Then you will find you would replay each song from the album all over again.
