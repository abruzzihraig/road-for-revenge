### Catch Cold
I have sick today. This is the first time I catch cold in Melbourne. With a little bit headache and a sore throat, I asked for leave immediately after waking up. Thanks for my girlfriend(not sure if I could call her girlfriend, actually we have broken up), she left some medicines that can save my life.

But sometimes I donâ€™t want to live even a second. No one could understand what is the real loneliness. I just want to escape from this world all the time.
