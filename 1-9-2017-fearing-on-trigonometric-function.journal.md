### Fearing On Trigonometric Function
It’s the time to sleep. I worked a whole night on the Canvas. I was really disgusted by the trigonometric functions in code. I felt dizzy when I tried to handle different angles with positive or negative quadrants. And the combined Canvases are too complicated when I clip those shapes with different angles as well.

So disgusting the code is, I don’t want to see it again.
