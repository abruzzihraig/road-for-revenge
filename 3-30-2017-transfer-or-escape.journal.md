### Transfer Or Escape
I would have written a journal which indicates why so many people nearby me want to become designers, but I don’t have much time today. It makes me a little bit panic. Just like what I saw the career Front-end developer is called easy to earn so that many unprofessional guys especially those who doesn’t have any special skill in society tried to learn it from community. That’s why among the front-end developers, the difference is such huge. 

I can’t help to think what if the world of designers have the same rules with programmer? Does any professional designer would think those guys who try to transfer to design is totally terrible thing? From my shallow experience in work, the key point might be how to learn to be professional.
