### Good Start
It is a good start to revive myself. I like the feeling to make myself controlled by some significant tasks.

I read two chapters of a grammar book today; It describes how to analyze the structure of noun clause and what is the right structure for the grammar.

Then I listened a Live which introduced how to make a good career planning of programmer. The speaker was the former technical director at Google. He answered some questions from the community. Most of the questions are useless to me, but I am interested in his view about how to be promoted at Google.

But it is too late right now. I have to go bed to sleep. Otherwise I cannot get up tomorrow in time.
