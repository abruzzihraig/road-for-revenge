### Indoorsy
Itâ€™s just a gaming day, and nothing needs to record as before. I played the Dark Souls 3 a whole night with my friend Chong. We got through a maze and tried to fight with multiple intruders, but we all died.

I started to search some compelling dramas again due to the boring weekend. I should have been going to barbecue with my friends tomorrow, but since they invited so many new guys that I didn't familiar, so I declined them politely. Maybe we could have a board game when we don't need to invite so many people.  After all, the scenario of many people always makes me feel awkward.

Give tomorrow another relaxing expectation, and hope the time flows slowly.
