### Better Way To Write
It’s too late today, so I have to write less then before.

Yesterday I’ve written that I don’t want to write a journal as a boring flow. So yes I have some new ideas today. That is, focus on one or two points each journal to make them meaningful.

For this purpose, I tried to find some books which could teach people who don’t have any English writing experience or relative culture just like me. The book should focus on how to write rather than just grammar. Through a series of researches, finally, I decided to read the book ‘On Writing Well’ first.

I started to read the book ’On writing Well’ tonight, even if reading it is slower than Chinese book. I just read a few pages on the first chapter, but it still aroused my sympathy.

The significant part I excerpt below:

> That condition was first revealed in the 1980s, when people
began writing on word processors. Two opposite things happened.
The word processor made good writers better and bad
writers worse. Good writers know that very few sentences come
out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time.
For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to
fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and
reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. Bad writers
became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy
and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen. How could
such beautiful sentences not be perfect?

That condition made me surprised, because It almost same as occurring on the careers software engineer or designer. Maybe they are all belong to a career which creates craft.

I’ve seen many software developers after I graduated from school. And I realised there are two opposite ways they are walking on, just like the different writers above. Some developers improve their skills everyday, using much time to think how they could make business logic simpler, how they could make code more maintainable and clear, how to use a better way to balance aesthetics and performance and, how to use advanced parts on programming languages.

As for other developers who just walking on the opposite way, copying verbose code everyday. They often import so many libraries with different qualities to project, then use those APIs with smatter to make the project finally comes apart like a shit.

If we want something tasteful, we want something beautiful and meaningful, why wouldn’t we choose the right way to create our crafts? Also that is why I should choose a better way to write.
