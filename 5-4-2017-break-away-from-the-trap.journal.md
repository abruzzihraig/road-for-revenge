### Break Away From The Trap
It’s late again. After calculating what I wasted both of money and time on the mobile game SanGuoZhiCaoCaoZhuan online(let’s call it simply SGZ), I suppose it is time to face the truth that I have to say goodbye for the best memory I got from the game.

Playing the SLG game always makes me excited, and SGZ is the best SLG game in my heart from my childhood. I’ve paid it more than 4300 RMB, and every day I spend much of time from I got home till I sleep. It has been invading my regular life. I don’t want to get involved into it deeper, as I know from the current stage, I may need to spend more money on it but can only get a little playfulness from it.

If every day I need to pay 5 hours or more at the game, and every week I can’t help to recharge it more than $50, for only one month I will lose at least 150 hours and $250. Even if I may not use the time and money to do something positive, why shouldn’t I buy a Switch to play Zelda? I can taste more movies, dramas and fantastic games(I mean the game which contains full playfulness just like a kind of arts). I can learn a lot from those entertainments instead of repeating to level each role up in the game SGZ. There are more than 400 characters in SGZ, and most behaviours from those characters are similar.

I don’t refuse to pay for those mobile games if they satisfy me. You pay it earlier then you enjoy it sooner. I don’t like to be strict to use time exchange money. If I do so, I will lose interests soon. That’s why I paid it immediately when I started to play Clash Royale or SGZ. It’s just because they are worth to pay.

But there must be a limitation to prevent from getting involved by their mechanism of making money. Otherwise, I would become a sort of Gods of SanHe.
