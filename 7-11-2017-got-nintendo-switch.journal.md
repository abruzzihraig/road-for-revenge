### Got Nintendo Switch
I finally got the Nintendo Switch today. It absolutely worth to buy even if it doesn’t have enough games at the moment, you would love with its flexible design. I didn’t ready to start my journey of Zelda as I felt tired tonight. I’m going to sleep soon after finishing the video currently I am watching.
