### Long Way To Change The Company
I worked overtime tonight. For complaining, I sent a long email to my boss so that I don’t want to practice writing more today. The email will be displayed by the following portion.

> When can we rewrite the whole ks injection and the project venue portal? You don't actually know how bad these projects are. Every day we spent a few hours to find where a stupid bug comes from, then tried to fix it just by one or two line code. But found the stupid reason may take us 3 hours.

> If we fixed a bug, the fixed code might cause other side effects, then someday the new issues come again on JIRA. I don't want to waste our precious dev resources and time on such silly and unmaintainable projects more. I can promise even though we modify these existing code two years; the project won't be good as KDP. You shouldn't use me on such work that everyone can do it. And I actually cannot rescue the legacy code, the authors of Ks injection and venue portal are not real engineers.

> For example, I might pay at least one week to fix some silly issues on video insertion, and every time I fix one, the another issue comes. But I tried to rewrite the video insertion yesterday. You may not believe I just used 4 hours but implemented the same basic functionalities and effects as before. I'm totally confused why they could write code more than 2000 lines to implement such simple feature. They did those projects with the lowest related knowledge. You even can feel every part in those projects are full of the flavor from some developer question websites.

> I believe our backend projects are bad too. Everything about deploying and testing and debugging in our team is totally amateur. You cannot believe how stupid we are when debugging an issue in production online, just like debugging CPU. Do you believe I can finish both of front-end and backend of KS injection only 3 months? Do you really think the injection is difficult like what you guys thought? If I got any my best backend friend in China, I think we two guys can finish all work from Kakku set up only one year, and with high quality and maintainability.

> So don't be blind, there is no one can be called architect in this company. I don't think some people here can pass the basic tech interview. If you really care about the company, you should think about why we always produce the low-quality products with a bunch of issues/bugs, and also why we paid so much time on those shitty work.

> I don't want to see the same situation this year–we waste time on those bugs of the poor projects again and again.Then when close to the end of the year, there will be a voice urge us that we don't have time to make projects better or we don't have time to rewrite or we don't have time for anything except someone's bad decision.

> If you still don't care about the current low-efficiency status on everybody, and if you still think the dev team works normally as you expect. Trust me, someday the good guys will leave, and the bad guys will eat the company up.

Have a good night! Our leader will bring the new tasks tomorrow from his brilliant brain.
