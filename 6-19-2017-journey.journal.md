### Journey
I have no idea for the diary. After thought more than ten minutes, there’s still nothing come out from my head. I’m not good in these days, especially in the last weekend. I try my best to embrace new life without memory, but it is hard for me. There’s song named MiDian can express my current mood. That’s just my lonesome journey.
