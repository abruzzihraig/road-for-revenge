### The Handmaiden
I was shocked by a Korean movie The Handmaiden today. The film is adapted from a novel Fingersmith. It describes a suspenseful love story among a cheater, a maid, and a noble lady.

I admire the director Park Chan-wook of the movie from two years ago. He is absolutely a genius on directing movies. He was well-known for people by his famous Revenge trilogy: Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, and Lady Vengeance. If you have seen the trilogy before, you will find he is pretty like to direct B-movie. But the movie The Handmaiden got win-win between business and art.

I like movies directed by Park Chan-wook especially like what the shots (such as Long Take) controlled by him. And the taste of BGM as well. He always likes to tell you a story with dozens of reversals, but he finally could make sense on each part.

There is a shot impressed me. We often could see films to express the situation that time is flowing by a shot of a running clock. But how does Park Chan-wook direct it? He just keeps everyone sits on chairs, and control the environment lightness from light to dark, then back to light again. It just like sometimes a cloud blocks the sunshine but will reveal it after a few minutes. I cannot help to praise him when I saw the way to express time flowing.

I don't want to give you any spoiler on the movie. It is an art, and also is the best movie in 2016 in my opinion.

I don't know why Korean Movies are such great. But at least, there are lots of shitty Chinese Movies could be taken as carpets to make those overseas arts shining.

By the way, another film I watched today is a totally shit. It called Inferno. Don't pay for that, and don't spend your time on it as well.
