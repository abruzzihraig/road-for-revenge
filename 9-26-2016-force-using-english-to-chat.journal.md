### Force Using English To Chat
I made a new plan today for our project KDP in the next phase. Everything was fine but there was only one thing made me hurt. That was I nearly took 2 hours to discuss with my colleagues to explain some plans with my poor English.

Those guys sometimes looked at me with a kind of wired expression. Maybe they have tried their best to understand what I was saying just like I have did my best to figure out what did they think. That is a really challenge for me, but it also improved my speaking effectively.

I like that, that’s why I said to them first “I’m here just want to practice my English spoken with you guys”.

At night, my friends here Yifei and Ryan created a chat group, and force us chatting with English to each other. I pretty like this idea. Even though that made chat slowly. Sometimes I have to use Google Translate, but I really enjoy it. More practices could make us perfect.

After chatting, Yifei as a teacher she caught me lots of grammar mistakes, most of them are just my typos. But I am not ashamed with that. On the contrary, I even felt happy to get those feedbacks. We need to help and to learn from each other to make ourselves become excellent.

Long may the sunshine.
