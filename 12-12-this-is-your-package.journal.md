### This Is Your Package
Australia delivery always gives us surprises. I bought something during the Black Friday, and the estimated reach time is 1st Dec. But I didn't receive anything until the last Thursday—I got a Left Card in my apartment mailbox.

Left Card is a simple letter to tell you how to contact the delivery customer service and how to reschedule another delivery time. However, I didn't get any message or email to know when the consignment would come to my apartment. Then I just got the Left Card without any notification. So I have to rearrange the delivery date to this Monday.

In Australia, the delivery time is between 9 a.m.–5 p.m. and only for workdays. If it is fortunate, you will get your package before you leaving home. Or the delivery driver would give you a message before he comes, then maybe you have enough time to go back to home and sign your consignment.

But this time, I was totally failed. There is no any notification when the package will be sent, and there is also no any message before the driver comes. I called the customer service of Toll to ask them if they could give me a call before the driver comes to my home, then they just replied me that there is no way to contact with the driver.

Since that limitation above, and I have already rescheduled the delivery date to this Monday, so I had to ask for leave to stay and work at home this afternoon to wait for my package.

Until 4 p.m. there is nothing change on the online tracking information. So I made a call to Toll's customer service. Then I just got apologize, and I was told that I have to reschedule another delivery date. Can you imagine my feeling at that time? I even won't feel shocked if they do the same thing in tomorrow. That is the way Australians like. I have nothing to complain. Hope they love that and live better in the future.

As for the perfect closed cycle that you will never get your package if you work, you have to see it as a God's masterpiece. But God doesn't care about how could I get the package in tomorrow. Ask for leave again? If I were my boss, I would be fired by myself immediately.
