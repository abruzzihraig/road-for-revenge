        <p>I cannot believe marriage is so close to me. Each of my friends used to bet that I will be the last one who marries. The World is changing, and no one knows what a man will be in the next second.</p>
<p>For persuading my girlfriend to come to Melbourne with me, I took more than half year. There were only three roads appear on our eyes. I go back to Beijing, or she studies as a graduate student here to learn design two years, or we marry to apply a visa for her.</p>
<p>I know my girlfriend is not smart, she even has a little bit naive. I know she always goes back on her words. From the initial, she wants to study aboard in the USA. After a few months, she decided to go to Australia. At that time, she said she would get four 7 scores on IELTS test. I laughed at her and annoyed her. Nearly passed half year, she changed her mind to 6 scores. A few months later, she decided to get four 5 scores and to learn languages in AU before she studies in university. Finally, she got 4.5 scores and said to me she never wants to learn anymore, why I pushed her so much, and why she needs to waste the expensive tuition. In the meantime, she got a new interest again—Tattoo. Every day she told me she would be a tattooist, even though she never had the relative experience before two months ago.</p>
<p>Such a simple girl persuaded everyone includes her parents and me. Won’t learn anymore, and will marry to me to live together. I am not sure if I am sober. Maybe my mentality has changed in these years. I know she has such defects, but I still love her. Even though we might have argument sometimes, but most of the time we were happy together. She is such a kind and lovely girl; sometimes I even want a daughter like her. I don’t want a savvy woman to help me to construct our family and careers. She gives me happiness all the time, and I think that’s enough for getting a shared future.</p>
<p>This afternoon, she told her parents our ideas. Her parents truly love her more than me. They finally agreed her decision. If she actually doesn’t want to learn, why don’t give her freedom and happiness? I have already got an excellent opportunity to get the PR so that she doesn’t need to pay so much effort to come with me. That’s my duty to take care of her.</p>
<p>She told her parents that we might be able to get marriage certificate first. Then I could use it to apply a working visa for her to live in Melbourne. She could learn languages in some courses if she needs. Also, any free time she could learn and try to be a tattooist. If I were in China, I wouldn’t think about the idea a second. I’m not sure if it is a right way to make us happy or enjoyable for the future life. I hope we could figure out those tough issues during the road. If we need money, I will pay more efforts with my smart brain. If we need responsibility, I will learn and reflect more on what I did. Hope her could understand my heart.</p>
<p>As my imagination, to marry her after two or three years could be better. At that time, we could have the PR. I may get an ideal job. She will have a good English skill and a little work experience. That will make us learn more from each other; then we may know how hard to live in this cruel society and the world. It will be the best life experience to teach us how to cherish each other.</p>
<p>Finally, It would be better if she could study as a graduate student. That’s because I haven’t prepared anything about marriage. It is enormous pressure for me, and I don’t want to give my future wife a cheap memory.</p>
<p>Stress!</p>
