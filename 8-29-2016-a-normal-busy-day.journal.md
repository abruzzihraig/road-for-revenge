### A Normal Busy Day
I have code more than 12 hours today. Now I am tired and I just want to go bed to sleep.

Xibo is a good partner even if he didnâ€™t have so much experiences in front-end. But he is smart and he knows how to learn techniques. At the mean time, he also works hard especially when I ask for him if he could work over time.

For our urgent deadline, for our professional project, and for my personal ideal, I chose working over time to implement the product as soon as possible.

I have nothing to say this day. Hope the tomorrow we could achieve more tasks.

Bless me could saving some time.
