### Canvas It Hurts
I tried to implement an effect that flipping web page from a page corner. It is a requirement by our Ad injection service, and it is designed for switching between the original website and the Ad content more humanized.

In general, it is similar to the effect page flipping when we use some fantastic reading apps such as iBooks. It simulates an exact physical situation when we try to flip a page in a book. I studied the page effect from a blog which written by an experienced graphic developer. He taught us that how to deconstruct the physical effect to a mathematic model, and how to avoid some traps in Canvas on modern browsers.

I don’t have enough experience on Canvas before so that I don’t have the confidence to make everything done on the page flipping effect. I tried to analyze the interaction model to comprehensible conditions to ensure the current technologies could implement the effect on browsers.

I also made some sketches to expound how many difficulties need to be overcome. That is not a simple work for me. I am afraid that my colleagues would complain about it.

No matter how tricky the feature is, at least the first step has been taken.
