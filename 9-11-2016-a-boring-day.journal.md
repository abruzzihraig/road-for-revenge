### A Boring Day
Sorry I am late to write the journal, and it is nearly 3 a.m. now. Since I chatted with my university classmate in the evening, he wanted to realise something about how to apply a job of Australia. So I am late.

I have to go bed to sleep for tomorrow work, so I wonâ€™t write anything today. The only one thing I know is today is a boring day.
