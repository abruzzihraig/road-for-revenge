### Everyone Likes Wok 
Everyone likes wok, but no one knows where it does come. As my Chinese workmate said it does not belong to Sichuan, and another Chinese workmate was living Beijing also thinks it does not belong to Beijing as well. No matter where it comes, we took our Australian workmates to try it in this noon.

While we enjoyed the wok, we always hold our smartphones to translate what English name of the material the foreigners was eating. We didn’t try the highest level on chili, but the taste still made us satisfied. Also, the price of the wok in Melbourne is low; we’d like to get it more in the future.
