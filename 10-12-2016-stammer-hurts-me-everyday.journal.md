### Stammer Hurts Me Everyday
Let me pray for my boss first. He is such a generous guy! He approved me to exchange my overtime to a few days off. I’ve worked more than 43 hours overtime this month. That means I could get more than one month vocation with the rest of my annual leave. The Chinese New Year is waving its hands for me.

I don’t know why it is hard for me to speak English smoothly just like Chinese. There are always something break me in, even though I know how to speak and how to organise a sentence to make sense. But once I open my month, my tough will be frozen suddenly. I cannot speak even a simple word sometimes. That’s actually make me depressed.

I know I have a little bit stammer. But when I use Chinese, I could choose another synonyms quickly if I feel my tough is blocked by a word. So there were little people know I have a slight stammer. But when the situation is changed to English environment. I am totally failed. I guess I could be known as a stupid in the eyes of others.

But how can I get rid of the nightmare? It is hard for me and it is extremely unstable. Sometimes I could speak anything smoothly from my mind. But sometimes I could feel there is an old witch is using a toilet plunger stab into my mouth. I really want to explain to the guys who I was talking to. The frozen time during a talk is always make me embarrassed.

Does anybody have a good idea? I really hope there are some useful recommendations and experience for me.
