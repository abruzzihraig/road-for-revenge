### Write A Diary Like A Geek

Even though I never thought I was a geek, for the revenge of writing journals, I have to admit I devoted some efforts on it to make the whole plan works better. It even has a little bit funny.

I’ve created a new repository [DayOneFlow](https://github.com/abruzzihraig/DayOneFlow), which is my personal workflow for writing journals easier. Since I am a programmer, I have to develop something to reducing insignificant time using. That’s my main purpose to create the repo.

The script is available for normal compiling and deploying, but it still need to update for more essential requirements. I will finish it these days if I have free time. Soon or later I will write a technical journal to record how it works. But today, let us ignore it.

In late today, I tried an excellent app [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), which is an English grammar checking tool. It could help you find any typo or grammar issue by analyzing your articles. It is awesome especially when you got a premium version. The premium version could give you more advanced advice, and it also calculates a score according to your post. But It’s really expensive, more than $130 per year. Hope it’s worthy.

I tried to modify a post Cozy Space by the Grammarly App. It just gave me 55 scores with lots of issues on right side of the post. I nearly took half hours to make everything right for its check. Indeed I learned many details that I have already known but not pay attention to.

Anyway, Hope we can improve our knowledges everyday.
