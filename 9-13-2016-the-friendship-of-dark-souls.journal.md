### The Friendship Of Dark Souls

Itâ€™s too late to write, I have an important meeting tomorrow, so I have to write less.

Tonight I met a new friend in the game Dark Souls 3. Even though we cannot speak or write anything in this game. We just used our body movements and some limited formatted messages to contact with each other.

We used the difficult way to make each other to know a complex purpose: Invaded one by one to get 30 scarce props. The 30 props finally could make us to get a platinum trophy of the Dark Souls 3.

I should have written the whole story detailedly. I find this friendly guy online is an actually surprise. We finally add each other as friend on WeChat.

The game process is just like the game Journal, It made me felt truly warm.
