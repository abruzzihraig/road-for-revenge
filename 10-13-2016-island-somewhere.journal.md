### Island Somewhere
Since daylight saving has become, the sunset is getting more late everyday. After one hour overtime, there was still light outside. So I decided to buy some food from market.

There was a little wind with warm sunshine. I walked relaxedly and a few songs of Coldplay were around my head. I can’t help to take a breath then, everything on the road was fresh to me.

I became to think what is my final destination. Beijing? Melbourne? Sydney or a city in US? I don’t know if every step is safe to my future. But I indeed enjoyed the moment I can feel everything comfortable within the beautiful city.

That might be a dreaming island parts of you want to be in, isn’t it? So I should be satisfied even though there are some shitty work are waiting for me all the time. I am a fortunate guy, I have such an opportunity to break out GFW to live in a free and clean island. It should have been a pleasant experience. I need to stop complaining more and to enjoy the truly free time.
