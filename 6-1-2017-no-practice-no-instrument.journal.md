### No Practice No Instrument
A few days ago, there was an ad of a second-hand guitar which published in WeChat publisher account. It aroused my interest in guitar collection. The selling one is Taylor 1101e, and its holder wanted to sell it as 80% of the original price.

Then I consulted with my friend who has lots of experiences with all kinds of guitar brands. As his recommendation, the Taylor 1101e is not worth to buy as I have already had a better one than that. But he still gave me another surprise–there is an Australian brand of the guitar named Maton, it can be as great as Martin or Taylor could be. Besides, Tommy Emmanuel endorses it! I have to get one in this country. So let’s do more practices first to give the requirement a reason.
