### Cozy Space

Today I eventually got the 4K monitor! It took nearly one month to delivery, the waiting is hard for me. In Australia we have to face the truth that receiving date depends on how many mistakes would be made by those service providers. That means you need luckiness to wait and do not overly concern about it.

No matter what at least I’ve got them. It really makes me happy, everything is simple and neat. With melodious music from the Stanmore Speaker, I am so relax now. I never feel good on jazz but now, the jazz is soft and lazy, it makes me reminder a lonely game Fallout 4. There are many radios in it play different jazz music around by you, and your dog.

There still are something lack, first I need a new touchpad for home, I don’t want to bring so many accessories come and go between home and office. For preventing someday I lost touchpad at home, I need get a new one. Besides I also have 2 of $50 coupons could reduce on that. Another I want is a floor lamp beside my desk. I plan to buy it from IKEA after my girlfriend left.

As for the new monitor, Actually I was worried about if my computer could use the so high-resolution monitor. Due to my macbook was released in late 2013, it doesn’t have a individual graphics and the integrated graphics might not afford the high resolution.

After trying it with my macbook, as expected it has low performance on some kinds of ratios. But if I scale it as a normal ratio(1920x1080) or as a more space ratio(3840x2160), it is fast just like my macbook itself. Even if sometimes I might scale the ratio to a low-performance state, I suppose it is enough for coding or watching videos.

I also tried the 4k monitor with PS4. But It is disappointing, because PS4 just supports 1080P, it can’t reach the 4k resolution. Moreover I can not set speaker to PS4, that means I have to use headset on my game handler, I can not bear it.

How cozy space for me, this one square meter is enough. I have Internet to find everything I am interested in. I have an iPhone, an iPad and a Macbook, they are all best smart devices in this world, look exquisite and high-quality. I have a 4K monitor with high-resolution screen, that means I could get a huge space on it, or I won’t see any distinct pixel point anymore. I have both of the best small keyboards, they are same but different, just like a pair of brothers. I have a good speaker and a comfortable headset, they are all come from Marshall, which is the most famous company to produce speakers for rockers. I could use Spotify, I could use Google, I could use everything best online services or apps if I want. No more walls like in China, that really makes me feel free.
