### Cozy Space

Today I eventually got the 4K monitor! It took nearly one month to delivery. The waiting is hard for me. In Australia, we have to face the truth that receiving date depends on how many mistakes would be made by those service providers. That means you need luckiness to wait and do not overly concern about it.

No matter what at least I’ve got them. It makes me happy, and everything is simple and neat. With the melodious music from the Stanmore Speaker, I stay relaxing. I never feel good on jazz, but now, this kind of music is soft and lazy, it makes me remind a lonely game Fallout 4. There are many radios in it play different jazz music around by you, and your dog.

There still are something lack. I need to put a new touchpad at home for avoiding take many accessories between home and office. For preventing someday I lost touchpad at home, I need a new one. Besides, I also have 2 of $50 coupons could reduce on that. Another I want is a floor lamp beside my desk. I plan to buy it from IKEA after my girlfriend left.

As for the new monitor, I was worried about if my computer could use the so high-resolution screen. Due to my MacBook was released in late 2013, it doesn’t have an individual graphics, and the integrated graphics might not afford the high resolution.

After trying it with my MacBook, as expected, It has low performance on some kinds of ratios. But if I scale it as a standard ratio(1920x1080) or as a more space ratio(3840x2160), it is fast just like my MacBook itself. Even if sometimes I might scale the rate to a low-performance state, I suppose it is enough for coding or watching videos.

I also tried the 4k monitor with PS4. But It is disappointing, because PS4 just supports 1080P, it can’t reach the 4k resolution. Moreover, I cannot set the speaker to PS4, that means I have to use a headset on my game handler, I cannot bear it.

How cozy space for me, this one square meter is enough. I have the Internet to find everything I am interested. I have an iPhone, an iPad and a Macbook, they are all best smart devices in this world, look exquisite and high-quality. I have a 4K monitor with a high-resolution screen, and that means I could get a huge space on it, or I won’t see any distinct pixel point anymore. I have both of the best small keyboards, they are same but different, just like a pair of brothers. I have a good speaker and a comfortable headset. They are all come from Marshall, which is the most famous company to produce speakers for rockers. I could use Spotify, Google, and every best app or online service if I want. No more walls like in China. That makes me feel free.
