### Talented Designer
Itâ€™s already 4 a.m. so I cannot write much. You cannot imagine how lucky I am that could work with a talented designer in this messy office. After work, I discussed with our designer more than three hours on the website builder, from functionality to user interface. We always get the same result when we solve any problems from product design or UI logic, and that is really effective. I made many notes for the discussion, and for the next step what I need to do as well. It really makes me excited when working with smart and professional guys. Especially completists would be better. I would enjoy the time working with him and do more fantastic stuff together.
