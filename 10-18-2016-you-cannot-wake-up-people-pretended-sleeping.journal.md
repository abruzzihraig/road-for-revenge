### You Cannot Wake Up People Pretended Sleeping
It is another ineffective workday. The only one voice in my head persuaded me do not be angry at the words from someone who is extremely amateur. Even though he expressed like there was a discussion among the whole team, we all know that was just a show by himself. The decision had been made by him before the discussion began.

I have been programming four years more, but I never saw amateur stuff like they did. It seems like we three Chinese guys are always company a rude baby to create some kinds of shitty toys.

I cannot understand why he insisted on keeping two API calls for rendering a list in front-end. We just want to use one call for fetching a list of data to render the Advertisement list. They said some parts of data they have to fetch from another service. That's why we have to make multiple calls to get the data. Why can't they choose a cache server to fetch the 3rd-party service automatically? No one knows why. Maybe they know nothing.

Even though our Chinese backend guy gave him many recommendations to make the shitty works one call. But he still tried to find some stupid and weird reasons to reject the significant advice.

I think business in architecture should be layered. Each part of them has a proper position. For this evil decision, it is totally an excuse for making someone keep lazy and relaxing. They just want to put the messy business logic to front-end. Front-end is just a layer view, why it should handle the messy business logic which should have written in the backend? The only answer to me might be they know nothing about how to be a professional programmer and what should they do with a right way in software engineering.

God is blessing them that they are working in an incredibly lazy country. If any of them tries to find a good job in China, they will be rejected a thousand of times.

They pay me money anyway, how can I fight for myself to refuse the silly amateur solution? I'm just fucked and kept the fucking happy mood every day.
