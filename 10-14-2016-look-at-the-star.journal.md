### Look At The Star
There is a bad news that the PS VR I’ve already preordered has been delayed to deliver, and the estimated date of shipment is due in Dec 2016. Please be happy with my sorrow.

Since Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in literature yesterday, I am curious about how excellent writing does he have. I cannot actually understand the poems from his lyrics and his duck-like voice. Even though I heard his songs from junior high school, and I also know lots of his stories. So I decided to find a biography of himself.

He wrote a book called Bob Dylan Chronicles, it describes his legendary life during the luminous period when he made folk music revive in America. He was indeed a talent in that era. I suppose I could feel a few elegant sentences in his writing, it is easygoing rather than obscure.

When he described an environment, he wrote a paragraph like below:
> Out side the wind was blowing, straggling cloud wisps, snow whirling in the red lanterned streets, city types scuffling around, bundled up — salesmen in rabbit fur earmuffs hawking gimmicks, chestnut vendors, steam rising out of manholes.

There is a picture of the sense around you when you read the paragraph, isn’t it? It just like yo u lived with him in the story.

However, when he wrote about himself, it comes with below:
> What I was playing at the time were hard-lipped folk songs with fire and brimstone servings, and you didn’t need to take polls to know that they didn’t match up with anything on the radio, didn’t lend themselves to commercialism.

You could find a little ridicule on his words, the sentences are concise with a little sharp.

Since my reading speed is still slow, so I just read a few pages on the sample of the book. I wish I could read more if I have time. Because he is a hero and a true star to me, I am interested to learn more from his writing to know what did he think in his legendary past.
