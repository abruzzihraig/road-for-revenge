### Shitty MacOS
I cannot write today, because I just fix my keyboard to make it available on the latest beta version of MacOS.

I am extremely mad for that, the Apple is becoming more and more shitty. It changed keyboard drive again and again. Then the Karabiner has to be updated by the changes. Now the Karabiner doesn’t work, how can I use the original keyboard mapping on my HHKB?

How can I work effectively tomorrow? Do I have to take another keyboard to my office? Fuck the Apple.

I almost forget that Trump has become the new president. It is really funny and I can’t help to see more stories on him.
