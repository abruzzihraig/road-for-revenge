### Unknown Destiny
I swear I have already tried my best to develop the new project KDP. But I still scare that no one supports me on those work. Never mind, I just need one month to confirm my points and values. If we still get a same situation on such small startup after that, I will quit without any regret.

Today I finished an important work, that is making a professional project procedure. After tried some project management tools, finally I find there is no good project management app online.

I’ve tried Asana, Trello and Teambition. Actually they three are the widely accepted management tools. But I think they still have their individual defects.

Trello is more similar to a to-do list. It doesn’t have a calendar to make a global plan on a project.

Asana is good, and I really like their design. They have the best front-end guys and the excellent designers. But for interacting with team members, it has a little complex. There is no way just like making to-do list cards directly on it. So the procedure for developers might not good as Trello or Teambition.

Among of these tools, the Teambition should be the best. But unfortunately, the Teambition has some bugs recently, and it has bad network in Australia.

So that I tried to find another one for making a project procedure better.

Finally I found it. That is a Mac app OmniPlan. It is so expensive that I have to use a cracked version.

I used it to create a whole month plan on our project. I could make different phases on it. Then I could specify a time on each task. After that, I could assign a developer on those tasks.

After made the whole procedure, the OmniPlan could export all kinds of reports, especially the Gantt, that is the best graph for me to know every detailed part in our plan.

Hope my colleagues doesn’t have any enmity on my work. All of I did just want to help this startup grows bigger and more professional. Please do not think I will take the bread out of your mouth. I don’t have such a great plan on such a small company.

So wronged I am.

Try my best then wait for destiny.
