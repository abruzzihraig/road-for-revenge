### Experience Of PS VR I
It's time to write something about PS VR. Even though I didn't play it these two days, and I even worked overtime tonight more than five hours. To some extent, it alleviates my guilt on those gaming time.

Since I had bought two games and had downloaded them before I got the PS VR, and there is also a demo disc within the box. So I had already been able to play a bunch of games when I connected the PS VR to my PS4.

The games I purchased in advance are Thumper and Kitchen.

The Kitchen is a short demo of the new Resident Evil. And it only has three minutes content to play. I played it two times, but none of any time I could open my eyes because it is holy horrifying.

You woke up in a kitchen, and you were tied to a chair. Your friend was trying to cut off the rope that tied your hands. Suddenly, there was a crazy woman took a knife and pierced your friends heart with it. The man fell immediately at in a pool of blood. With the screaming cry, the crazy woman stabbed you multiple times with the knife. I almost felt the pain, so I closed my eyes instinctively.

Even if it is only three minutes, but I was shocked. My friend thinks that I was brave enough because he even cannot play it with a headphone.

As for another game Thumper. For me, it is just like a kind of music/rhythm games just like what we used to play on our smartphone.

The game takes advantage of the features of virtual reality. And it will shock you with five different senses: sight, hearing, rhythm, height gap and the shake of a controller. It brings you a situation which is a little bit similar to a roller coaster. With the tense music rhythm, you will concentrate when you need to tap with a note. It is not another scary game like the Kitchen. I suppose it will be popular for girls.

Ok, it is already 2 a.m. I need to sleep to revive in tomorrow morning. So let me write more experiences from the games of PS VR in the next time.
