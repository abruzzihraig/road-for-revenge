### Fat Princess Has Free
I didn’t write diary yesterday as I slept when I was watching TV last night. I even slept more than 11 hours, but that made me feel good today, especially it brought high productivity to me in work.

There’s a free game released in PlayStation Store, which is called Fat Princess. I learned about it from many months ago, at that time I saw each comments for the game said it would certainly be a free game someday for PS members, so I didn’t buy it. That’s a wise decision has been proven today.

I’ve tried Fat Princess about three hours, and I think the game it will be fun if playing it with friends. The single player mode does not really touch me. During the three hours I just died once. That made me feel bored and sleepy. I will keep the rest story to play with my friends together, hope we could have fun with it.
