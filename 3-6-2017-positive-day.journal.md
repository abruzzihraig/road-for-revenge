### Positive Day
Since I lived in Melbourne, I had never been such positive before today. I nearly took more than 6 hours of those significant things after I came back to home.

I practiced my guitar, and I learned TypeScript more. Also studied and took practice on English speaking and grammar. Except that, I read the book 设计的觉醒 more as well.

I recorded my sentiments of those stuff on Trello. The ritual sense really hit me a lot. It gives me more courage to fight against laziness.

But the time is still lost control, so I have to sleep now. Hope tomorrow could be a more efficient day.
