### Face To The Health
Today is an actual festival for family reunion. But my girlfriend felt depressed. Her father was reviewed by a doctor, and the doctor said that he needs to make a surgery for a tumour on his skin.

Actually, he did the same surgery 2 years ago, but recently he was reviewed that the tumour is relapsed again. The doctor advised him to do the same surgery again.

So that my girlfriend is worried about him. Because the tumour is under his ear. That means if the tumour needs to be cut, his ear has to be peeled first. It will make a severe pain to himself.

Another thing made her anxious is that if the tumour relapsed again and again, who can make sure the disease would be cured indeed? It should have a nice festival today, However,  her family were falling into the nervous for the father’s tumour. I companied with her searched some information about her father’s disease, but we find more, we worry more.

Hope everything would be fine, and hope her father could make the surgery as soon as possible. Learn the condition of her father from doctors is better than search online.

That also reminds me to face the health problem. I need to be more healthier to prevent someday when I am old but with some diseases. I don’t want anyone especially my family or my friends worry about my body.
