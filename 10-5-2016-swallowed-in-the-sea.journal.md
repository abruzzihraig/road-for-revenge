### Swallowed In The Sea
Our boss showed the KDP project to the clients in Sydney today. And they said the work is awesome and brilliant. Yes, we should celebrate for ourselves.

So we just need to ensure the service stable when our boss shows the KDP to clients in Tokyo at tomorrow morning. Hope everything is fine for the present.

There was a melody around my head tonight. It is a song from Coldplay, but I don’t know what is its name. It made me remind that I am still a music lover. I cannot live if there is no music in my life.

I tried to find what is the name of the song. I listened songs one by one in Coldplay’s albums from Spotify. Each of the songs made me remind so much in my past life. There were some memorises were sticked by those songs. Any piece of the songs had been associated with my happy or sad moments. They all are the evidences of my truly living.

Finally, I figured out the song. It named ‘Swallowed In The Sea’. Just like a kind of song by humming. Chris Martin has an angelic voice, so that’s why the song could touch us deeply, even if it is just humming.

I miss my guitar and my youth. Wish I can get my guitar back to here when next time I returned to China.
