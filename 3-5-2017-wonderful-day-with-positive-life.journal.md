### Wonderful Day With Positive Life
It’s the first day we tried to use Trello to record our daily tasks. I learned about Design and TypeScript more than 3 hours. And also I did practice on my guitar playing. It’s a significant day. I hope we could insist the habit until we could get the victory on the end date of the first period.

The book 设计的觉醒(I cannot find its English name) taught me a lot, even though I just read it 50 pages. As the author and the father of MUJI, Ikko Tanaka is an absolute master of graphic design. He inspires me how to enjoy life with a moderate way like MUJI. We shouldn’t seek the excessive and luxury comfort that exceed what we have.

It would be better tomorrow if I could insist like today.
