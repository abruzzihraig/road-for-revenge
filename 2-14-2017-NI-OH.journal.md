### NI-OH
Hmm... I lost my words again. Paid a whole night to try the recently best sold game NI-OH. Since there are so many articles says how good the NI-OH is, and IGN even gave it a 9.6 high score, so I cannot help to check if it is indeed an amazing game. By the way, the NI-OH has been sold out in Japan.

The NI-OH seems like the game Bloodborne. You can find lots of similar features between they both. For example, in NI-OH you only have one life, if you died, you have only one opportunity to pick up the souls(kill enemies could gain their souls just like Dark Souls) you lost in which you died. But if you died during the road again, you will lose the souls that you had gained forever.

Also, the NI-OH has similar difficulty with Bloodborne. Unless you use the unique skill—by collecting anger and killing lots of enemies, otherwise you could be killed by any of medium-level enemies with their combos.

It’s a good game, but it cannot be compared with Bloodborne or Dark Souls. It’s more like Dark Souls 2. I don’t like so many enemies in a complicated map.
