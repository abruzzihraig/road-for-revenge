### Best Pursuit Battle
I have to recommend you guys the Korean variety show Infinite Challenge again. Tonight, I watched a special edition that pursuit battle which called One Hundred Bald Head. The episode is 347â€”the Super 7 guys still were there. It has to be the best pursuit battle that I never saw it before.

If you used to see an anime Lire Game by Shinobu Kaitani(one of my favorite cartoonists), you would know the most amazing part in the game is complicated relations among a group of people. Everyone in the group must try their best to protect their interest to get the final victory. So that you can see there are so many activities in human nature, such as betray or ally some people anytime. Hence the story of this kind of game is full of hints and reversals. The show I watched tonight is just like this type of game.

The One Hundred Bald Head is a game that there are seven cases which are locked within one hundred bald heads, and only 2 cases could have three million cash or negative one. The seven MC Members need to find those cases and search some clues for checking if a case has cash or nothing.

Since the game is performed perfectly by those seven MCs, you will laugh and be shocked every minute by their intelligence. It absolutely would change your impression of variety shows.

Just search and enjoy it when you have nothing to do.
