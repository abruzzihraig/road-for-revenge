### Passed Bloodborne
There is nothing worth to record. I was playing games whole day, and finally I got the platinum trophy of Bloodborne. Passed Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 even made me felt depressed. Thatâ€™s because in my mind, there is no better games than the both worth to play.

My girlfriend needs to take the IELTS speaking test tomorrow, hope she could take it easy and get an ideal score.
