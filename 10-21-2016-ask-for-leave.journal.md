### Ask For Leave
I just wrote a long email to ask for leave during Chinese New Year. It should also be my journal today, so I move it to below.

Hi Yee,

I felt a little bit depressed about you said that we’d better ask for a leave shorter than two weeks. Since Xibo was there, so some words I couldn’t tell you. But I think I have to let you know.

I made a plan for a month leave because I still have 19 days of annual leaves. And I also recorded I’ve worked overtime more than 44 hours. That should be equal to 5 days. It means I could have 24 workdays to leave for the next half year.

You know I don’t have friends or family here, so I don’t have anything worth to ask leave. But as an employee, I should have right to use the leave rather than work constantly. That’s why I am always working hard because I want to get rest with my girlfriend, family, and friends when I live my vocation. That will return fairness to my hard work, and it also makes me full of passion on work.

But I also know in a company, to allow an employee to leave a month might be dangerous, especially during the normal working days. Since Chinese New Year is usually in February. Ask for leave during those days may disturb others work. And I think that’s why Ruby could ask for a leave nearly a month because it is during the Christmas, no one works here, and there is nothing to do. I understand the situation. It is an interesting problem I’ve never thought.

That means maybe I have to have a long vacation during Christmas even though I have nothing to do. Ideally, I just want to spend the statutory holidays then save my personal days of leave for Chinese New Year. It seems maybe I have to compromise for our company.

But can we figure out a better solution? Because this Chinese New Year is important to me. You know the Chinese Year is the biggest holiday, it nearly continues half month. I will take my girlfriend to my home; she will see my hometown and my family and my friends. It is important to us. I wish you could understand. And you also know my hometown is Xinjiang. It is long travel from Beijing to Xinjiang.

I need to see friends in Beijing, then we need to see her family in Hebei, then we need to take a flight to Urumqi to see my relatives, then we need to take a flight to my hometown Yining to see my family and friends. You’ll see that indeed needs a long vacation. And that’s why I felt depressed. But I understand you, and I also know my work is important to the company.

Or, can I work outside if you guys need me to develop something? I think I could cover that because the vacation for me is not just to play. Most of the time we just need to see some people(relatives, old friends) or have a dinner with them. I think I have enough time to work.

If one month is still unacceptable for you, can we make it three weeks? Two weeks are too short for those personal affairs. Of course, one month is the best for me. You know when I told my girlfriend that I might only get two weeks vacation she nearly cried.

Another thing I want to make sure with you is whether the annual leave would be expired after July? If it does, I want to use them out before the next July. Or maybe the leave could be exchanged to payment? I don’t know, hope you could tell me that. After all, no one likes work hard in an unfair environment. I don’t want to work hard and lose my leave then see others enjoy their vacation and keep lazy on work. I think you understand the feeling.

thanks,
Yang
