### The Way To Destination

I was working overtime the whole last week.

After I released a new version, I heard my colleague said no one force me to work hard, and everything I did overtime is what I asked for.

These words made me extremely angry. Because I didn’t tell anyone how I was tired, I didn’t force anyone work hard or work professionally for the work relating to me. I even didn’t tell anybody I released the new version at 3 a.m.

I don’t need a word ‘Thank you,’ but I cannot accept anyone who said I am so tired because that is what I asked for.

Why I have to do overtime on the project because I want to build something professional, I want to develop a project standard, rather than like the kids toys what they did before in this technical team.

I cannot believe even though I have already tried my best to suffer the shitty techniques in my team. I don’t force anyone who just wants keep the shitty work as before. But there are still some people think I have infringed their interest. Yes, because they just want to take money with the relaxing shitty work as before. I even do not want call them software engineers or web developers. They did the work just like any other work which doesn’t need some knowledges or techniques.

I don’t care about your mediocre attitude on work. My friend persuaded me that if you want to make a delicious dish, you cannot make it on a cesspit. Yes, he is right, the team on technique for me is  totally a cesspit. Maybe I shouldn’t pay any effort on those shitty work and in this complacency team.

Whatever your boats flow, work the shit with you is not my destination.

On the next phase, I should rethink about how could I improve my personal interest on the spare time. I won’t work overtime anymore, and I won’t make any project standard. Because even if I make effort on those work, there still are some one against me.

What a small company! There are only six guys in the team. Why it has so many complex office politics!

If we have two kinds of worldview as a programmer, why you didn’t give any respect on my professional work? Am I infringed any interest on you? Don’t you feel ashamed?

Fuck this team, and fuck this work. I don’t care about how bad you did before, anyway you will prevent me to improve the shit better. That’s fine, I won’t play with you. Someday I will meet some respectful and advanced people, all I need to do is enter the team which is appropriate for me.

So I need to change my strategy to make more interests for myself after work. I cannot lose my original intention, and I must seek the destination using my whole life. At that time, you boring guys will be ignored. That’s why I called it revenge.
