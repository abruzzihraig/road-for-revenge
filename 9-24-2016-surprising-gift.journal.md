### Surprising Gift
Tomorrow is my birthday, but I suppose no one knows it here except myself.

However, after midnight, my girlfriend sent me a message which says ‘open your wardrobe, then find your gift under your clothes’.

I was totally surprised about that, I thought she couldn’t have sent a gift for me, because we are live in different countries now.

After I tossed off those clothes, then I found a white bag. There is a Mac TrackPad within!

I was so moved, because I know the new version of TrackPad is expansive, and I actually want ted to buy it for home, so that I don’t need to remember taking a trackpad between office and home everyday.

During her vacation, she knew I like it but she also knew that I supposed the price is too high to buy. And she thought so as well. We all thought that should not an essential requirement for me. Having it could make work convenient, but not for urgent.

That’s why I was moved, she knows what I liked, and she knows the gift is expansive, but she still wants to make a surprise for me at my birthday.

It makes me recall what I did to her today. I was strict to her Self Introduction which for applying to RMIT university. My words made her sad and upset. I feel so sorry to her, she loves me so much, but I always let her sad.

So that I took much time to explore a gift for her, finally I found a creative stuff that she must like. Wish when her birthday comes, she could feel a similar surprise with mine.
