### VR Is God
I’ve preordered a package of PS VR without telling to my girlfriend. Cause she doesn’t allow me to buy it. She always says the first version of VR is immature, we need to wait for the next stable version. But I actually cannot help to play it!

Everyday I imagine what if I could play games with PS VR. Is it immersed? Or it still be immature to make us feel unreal. The only thing I know is the sooner the PS VR is released, the longer I will be kidnapped at home.

Actually, only the PS VR is not enough to play, you still have to buy some other devices or accessories around it. For example, you need to buy a PS4 as the host machine, you need to buy a pair of sticks which called PS Motion for interacting with some special VR games, and you also need to buy a PS camera for detecting your position when you move. Surely, you need a TV as well.

Most of them I already have, and I also have a bunch of games on PS4. That means I just need to wait for 13th Oct, at which the PS VR will be released. A few days after that I will get the rest parts: PS VR and PS Motion.

Wish the day comes soon.
