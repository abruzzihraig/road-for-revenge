### The Way Spotify It Does
I pay for Spotify membership every month. If I only earn 100 bucks per month, I would still pick ten bucks for Spotify.

Spotify is the best music application in this world. It supports a bunch of magic in its service. For instance, if you keep running the Spotify apps on both of your mobile and computer, you can control either one to force another follow what your operations. If you at the first time to sign in Spotify on any device includes TV app, you can just play any song by Spotify in other devices whose Spotify has been logged in; then you can be logged on the new device without pain.

You are not only accessible with the high-quality music, but also the excellent playlist recommendation. There is a playlist called Discover Weekly in Spotify. It generally gives you what you expect as what you have listened and stared before. The strategy algorithm under the hood must be written by a group of smartest engineers. I listen to music more than 13 years, and I almost spend 30 hours per week on it. I always being a critic on listening to music, but the music by Spotify recommendation have an extremely high accuracy to target me. Every ten songs it recommends I may like at least 5 of them. It’s the best way for me to touch the music that unknown but has the taste same as what I favor.

If you haven’t tried Spotify yet, you should take the first step, and you will find a better music world.
