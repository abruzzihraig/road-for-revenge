###As An Old Driver
I hate to write anything after I played video games. Especially when I am so sleepy!

Tonight we Chinese colleagues had a nice dinner together. We are Xibo with his wife, my girlfriend, myself and our new colleague Barry.

Barry is an old driver who is good at everything about how to live better in Melbourne. He is 32 years old, but he still be single. So he thought that we were abusing him like a single dog.

Barry as a software engineer, he graduated from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In that age, he should have good skills and knowledges. Actually he is professional indeed.

We were talking about how to save money to buy a car, how to make a loan for buying a new house. Barry is always gave us some useful advices and experiences. He even know which area is peaceful and safe. As a driver, he told us everything he already knows.

However, I can’t help to ask him a question, how did he pay the down payment? After all, even if any citizen could make a loan of real estate reach to 80%, since the high price of a house, the down payment could be more than $150,000. That is a huge sum of money for me. I don’t know how he could save so much money for the down payment.

He told me honestly that he borrowed about $70,000 to $90,000 from his parents. And he just saved $90,000 when he wanted to buy a house. I calculated it as he said, that means he saved money about $15,000 per year. That should be acceptable for my income. But how long I could save enough money for a down payment? Oh how difficult to live without parents!

Whatever I could have a house someday. Just see the status I am working here as a trip, it would be comfortable.
