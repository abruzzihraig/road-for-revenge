### Dark Souls Re-afflicts
I was playing Dark Souls 3 a whole day, and this is my forth time playing the game. I have never played a game more than two times before Dark Souls. You can imagine how much I like this series. I will still enjoy the journey in the next two days, but now I have to sleep.
