### Balance The Mentality
I am always a paranoid guy from my childhood. Sometimes it made me full confidence to challenge the unfair world. Sometimes it swallowed my emotion to make me depressed.

There is a phrase in Chinese means when you realised something is bad, and you want to change it to right, do not overexert to make it bad again. This is the few word I often recall in my life.

Sometimes this feeling is like playing racing games. If you want to turn right, you shouldnâ€™t turn the steering wheal to the rightmost. Otherwise, you might get a circle in the same place. If you want to drive more fast and more smooth, you have to control the direction slightly. In our real life, it just like balancing your mood and status when you got an important challenge.

We all will meet some challenges just belong to us someday, whether we could achieve the final victory it depends on what strategy we want to choose. For me and for now, the key question which confused me is how to balance the mentality, to prevent me overexert on something specifically, to make myself get a global view.

My paranoid character is also influencing my close friends, especially my girlfriend. It often make them hurt, and it also make me guilty. Hope I could handle those challenges in my life peacefully, without any hurt on anyone at any time.
