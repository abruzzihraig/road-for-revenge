### Dive Into Hell
Itâ€™s too late again. I have to go bed to sleep. I played the game Helldivers with my friends the whole night until I heard birds warbled. The old driver Dolphin took we newbies to challenge some hard battles that really make you feel placing yourself in hell.

I am too sleepy to write. I am looking forward the next battle with those friends.
