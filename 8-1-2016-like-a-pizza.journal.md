### Like a pizza

Can’t believe that so many friends had noticed what I have done. Why you can find me? Does the timeline of yours is static?

Fine, never mind. I’ve got change something for the speeding that has been loosing control. But you, my friends, you can still easy to figure out what I am thinking if you are really interesting. After all you are always smarter then me.

It’s a time to record something, although I don’t want any words from my hand such like boring flow. But sorry, it is English, I need more time to learn how to control detailed grammar so as to assembly architecture of article.

Feeling helpless is an indescribable status that always around myself. Sometime it through my body to heart, made me depressed. Everyone asked me why you often seem unhappy and gloomy. Come on guys, there is always a person you have ever seen. Accept me with a little bit different, I’m just a guy who had through so many tragedies.

Today I won’t abuse someone, I don’t want to say fuck you every night in my dream. Actually I fight the man a few times in nightmare.

I’ve been here less than 3 months. So many unknown and funny things came along with me. Everyday I was involved to status ignorant. ‘Anyone who can help me’ I asked for myself on my brain. I’ve got have friends here, that is the most important thing then any other one.

You know I just like a man who from cartoon Polish Man. I don’t like talk with people especially those I did not know. So embarrassing it is! But I need friends here to live, so I bit the bullet to attend technical Meetup. Of course, Chinese guys. Astonishing, so bad I can’t believe they could find a job here. I guessed some of them would earn more then mine.

The meetup is so low-quality, so I don’t want to attend it again. Fortunately I still got 3 guys here. There is only one guy looked has good knowledge as a devops engineer. He just left from Netease then get here recently. The other two guys has a same age with me as graduating from Monash University. Anyway, I got 3 guys as friends here, in addition to the Chinese colleague nearby me.

Those friends helped me fixing so many issues on life. They are all kind person. But there still has something made me felt sad. That is, I noted those guys who has a same age with me always through wrong way on technic and profession, just like I used to be 3 years ago.

No matter what I suppose how should they solve the high-level problems first to prevent falling into traps. Nobody really could feel the source of problems. Continues with tired and unprofessional status, can not get a good job and, do not know what is a valuable part they should invest on profession. With the kindness on work, receive each of unreasonable requirement, then make themselves into the traps. So sad so helpless, can’t break the paper box with the soft body:

Just like a pizza.
