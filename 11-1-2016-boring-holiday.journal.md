### Boring Holiday
Emmmmm. It's another dull day. I got up nearly 2 a.m. Then I just had breakfast instead of lunch. Then the dreary day started.

I cannot remember how long I chatted with my girlfriend. The only one thing I can make sure is that I didn't leave my bed until night.

I didn't have any interest in learning today. So even there is no game worth to play, I still put myself to Bloodborne. That could make me passed the day quickly.

That's it. It's nothing worth to record today. Hope I could persuade our designer tomorrow. Blessing me.
