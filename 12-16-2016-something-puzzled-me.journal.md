### Something Puzzled Me
It is an email I sent to my boss this morning. It records something puzzled me while I work in the company.

Hi Yee,

Please don't tell anyone this email I will send to you. I just want to let you know what my feeling is.

Do you remember the auto-generate title format? It is an extremely simple feature. I just used two minutes to implement it. And it was finished yesterday as your final requirement.

But I received a change for it at this morning:

There is a screenshot describes "The Warden changes the title format, and it is changed to be the initial."

All work return to the initial again. And I feel myself seems like a joke. Everyone could put forward any requirement to me, but no one cares about my opinion. How could I open my eyes and bear to see something go wrong by some irresponsible decisions? I don't understand why you hire me to work as a factory worker. I suppose you just need to hire a general front-end developer, which would be enough.

Why do I need to argue with colleagues again and again? What is that I am trying to protect? Whatever how much effort I pay for Kakku, finally I just got a command, and someone told me that is the right way, and I have to do it like that. At the mean time, I have to offend colleagues to fight for a better result.

I work like what environment I described above every day. To me, it is like a war I daily attend. It really makes me disheartened. You don't know how much effort I spent to try to make the company better. I think you could feel that I had pushed lots of things in Kakku.

To be honest, I feel I cannot revive or change this company. It has too many diseases. No one here wants to make things better, except Justin and Xibo. You won't know how much obstruction we met in Kakku while we work on KDP. The dictator is still the dictator, the lazy man is still the lazy man, the slippery man is still the slippery man. There is always a question around me and Xibo: For such a small company, why can't we work to make things right and better together? Every day we live in a war, intrigue each other rather than work together. It's more like a Chinese Government department.

I'm not sure if I could insist until the day I could apply a PR in Kakku. My hope has been run off. The team won't become better. Instead, I brought much troublesome to this team from I joined. Maybe it's a wrong choice to join here, for both team and myself.

My girlfriend got a rejection from RMIT University. And she doesn't want to go to Monash University even though she got its offer. Now she doesn't have any interest in English learning for IELTS. And she only wants to be a tattooist. We argued nearly a month, which makes me tired.

I am losing the final hope that makes me keeping work in the team. I don't get a salary could match my ability and my effort, I don't have authority here, I have to offend colleagues to make things in a right way, I give my girlfriend much pressure, I cannot implement my value here, I cannot learn anything new here. So what is the reason I still keep working hard in the team? Only for the PR? Do I really want to bind myself to it? Every day I ask myself the same questions. You don't know how depressed I was in every night.

I don't know how long I could insist here. I have my ideal, but it seems I am losing everything I owned.
