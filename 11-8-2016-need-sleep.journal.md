### Need Sleep
I just took a shower a few minutes before, and I feel so sorry about that I don’t have enough time to write what I promised yesterday. Actually it is too late to write, I’ve been sleeping after 4 a.m. two days, and it is 3 a.m. now. I don’t want to feel ineffective in daylight, so I have to sleep now.

By the way, I watched three episodes of the third season of Black Mirror. It is awesome and shocking, but it also will make you feel depressed to everything around yourself.

I think I should write first when I come back to home tomorrow. That will prevent me write some useless content again and  again.
