### Review For Knowledge
Known my friend Dolphin got a good remote job made me feel a little bit nervous. Surely I am happy to see him finally could get the miserable life rid off. I don't want to see any of my friends lives terribly due to lack of money. Especially he is so professional as a front-end developer. I felt nervous just because I don't want to see myself become worse. If someday there is an excellent opportunity is waiting for me, do I have corresponsive abilities then?

I'm not sure. But I know I am falling.

I was listening to a Live from Zhihu at tonight. And it is a speech about how to learn effectively. During the speech, the speaker introduced an app that called Anki. He mentioned it many times in the Live. So I took my curiosity to try to figure out what is the Anki.

After searching Anki from some articles, I learned that Anki is just a simple tool for helping people to remember what they have learned. It will remind people what they have recorded in Anki with a form of flashcards. Just like some vocabulary software, it will use a sort of algorithm to help you to remember the card content and reminds you periodically to review.

Suppose I can try it a few days. But I know that is not the point to improve my current status.
