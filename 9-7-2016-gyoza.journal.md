### Gyoza
These days I ate outside. In general I always choose the Korean restaurant at the corner of the street nearby our office. As I am an adamant guy, so I always choose the same number one of their menu.

Sometimes I also choose to eat some Chinese food in a Guangdong restaurant which named Meiguiyuan, it located behind a street of my home. Although the fast food is easy to solve hungry, and it could save so much time on cooking, I still want to cook If I have time.

On the one hand, cooking by myself could save some money. On the other hand, It also makes my life interesting and significant. I actually enjoy the cooking time.

Today, when I was opening my refrigerator, I saw a bag of gyoza in the frozen box. So I decided to fry them. That’s my first time to fry something on a saucepan.

I called my girlfriend, and I wanted to got some help from her. I put my mobile on a shelf, so she could watch what will I do on the stove.

I was listening to her wisdom, while I poured some oil to the saucepan. But the oil looked a little less. Once I put any dumpling on the pan, it doesn’t have enough oil to wrap dumplings, so the first few dumplings were totally pasted.

I realised the problem immediately, so I did some preparation before the second batch. I defrosted the rest dumplings first, then I poured more oil on the pan. When the pan was not heated too hot, I put the second batch immediately. So that it could prevent the oil breaking out with the ice on those dumplings.

This time I could easily wrap oil on each of dumplings. Since there was a small fire, so I have enough time to turn over every one. Finally they all got a same golden colour.

As for the result, I have to say that is the best gyoza I have ever eaten in this country. Thanks for the assistance from my girlfriend. She made me enjoyable on each boring day.
