### Winter Comes
What a wonderful day it is. I didn’t meet any trouble within the work of today, and I even got apology and agreement from the leader—the argument about coding occurred in last week.

E3 comes these days, but there’s nothing worth to expect except the Monster Hunter World will release in early 2018. Along with the E3, Melbourne’s winter comes as well. Every morning I feel frozen when typing on my keyboard. From fingers to toes, I even cannot feel they are alive. At least, it’s better than hot seasons, doesn’t it?
