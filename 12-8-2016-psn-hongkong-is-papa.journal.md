### PSN HongKong Is Papa
I should have written something about Australian Express Mall Service, but since PSN HongKong brought a few funny games for PSN members this month, so I cannot wait to play the latest free games.

There is a new free game named Magicka 2. The first generation of the game I have played when I was in college. There is no many changes in the second generation. The most interesting part in this game is you can combine a variety of magic from some basic magical elements. It will make you scramble especially there are lots of enemies surround you.

Another attractive feature in the game is to play it with multiple players online. I played Magicka 2 with my friend tonight. In the game, we always kill each other accidentally but also revive each other among the enemies. You cannot imagine how funny the scenarios were.

It’s too late now, I have to sleep now for tomorrow’s work. So I just leave some careless words above to record my enjoyable night.
