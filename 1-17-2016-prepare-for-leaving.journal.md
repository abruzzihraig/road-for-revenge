### Prepare For Leaving
I am so sleepy and I can’t write too much. I just prepared something toning for the Friday’s leaving. I wrapped my PS VR for borrowing to my boss Yee. He wanted the device from the Christmas. So that he could play it with his family during I rest in China. Also, I downloaded some variety shows to my iPad for the long flight trip.

For the recent work, all the things in my part look well. I may give them a demo before I leave.

It’s a happy waiting time to me. Just keep relaxing and enjoy the next two workdays.
