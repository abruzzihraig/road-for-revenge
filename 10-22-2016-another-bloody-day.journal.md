### Sorry guys, it is another game day. I played the Bloodborne until 3 a.m. And for now, my girlfriend is giving me a call, so I have to make the journal short. And it’s indeed nothing worth to record.

I have to say the game producer Hidetaka Miyazaki is an artist. The game Bloodborne and Dark Souls are totally artworks. They are worth to spend your all free time on them. If you’ve played them, you will understand my feeling.

I still decide to play at tomorrow because I have almost finished it. There are only two final bosses are waiting for me. I don’t have any interest in other things.
