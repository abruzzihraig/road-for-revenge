### Time To Change
I read an answer from Zhihu, which is about how fallen a man could be. The answer really hit me a lot. Each sentence from it seems to aim at me and shoot me everywhere on my body.

So immediately, I came up with the idea that to create a mutual help group. We could defeat our faults that losing self-control all the time when we have free time. Everyone in this group must share his/her daily results from a created TO-DO list. If anyone who doesn’t achieve any item from their plan with a reason that doesn’t make sense, they are asked to put red envelop to others. As well as, they have to write a short review for their irresponsive behavior.

I also created a repository on Github, so that we could push our new plans and updated the results every day to it. It’s a good start to have an opportunity to change ourselves.

Will get better if we insist our plans.
