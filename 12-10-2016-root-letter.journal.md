### Root Letter
It's the first time I play an AVG game. Since PSN HongKong released a free AVG game Root Letter recently, so I downloaded it immediately and played it today.

Honestly, I don't really enjoy this kind of game. I'd rather it is an anime so that I could free my hands to eat some snacks without handling game controller.

Like what I said above, the game Root Letter is more like an anime. You use a game controller to push the story to continue. You could just think of the complicated operations as a series of combination of the operation Play and Pause.

Maybe I just cannot feel it, but I still keep respect on the games of the type AVG. At least, I like some animes which come from AVG, such as Steins;Gate. No matter what, I will try the Root Letter more. Maybe I will change my view then.
