### Inspired By Plants
I was too tired yesterday, and I slept without the diary. We didn’t see the Van Gogh’s exhibition as there were so many people kept in a long queue. We decided to get there early in the next weekend.

Instead, we used a half day to visit Royal Botanic Gardens. There were all kinds of plants that you cannot easy to imagine. There were nearly no any people so that we felt peaceful that we never had before.

Then we bought two board games Micro Robots and Puerto Rico, and we would have played them in my home. Since the manual is too long to read, we finally changed to play PS4. Those massive workloads made me sleepy, and I got bed immediately after they left.

As for today, I did nothing except having a chat with friends, watch videos, and thinking something about the upcoming IELTS test preparation of mine. I will write a plan for the test for applying PR at next year.
