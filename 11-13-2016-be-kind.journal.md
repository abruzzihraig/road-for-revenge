### Be Kind
Seems no time to write again. It is late and tomorrow is Monday that I have to go to the office early to attend a meeting which will discuss an issue on the UI design. I am sorry that means it is another careless diary.

My girlfriend complained that her sister’s father always comes to her home and lives a few days to do something in Beijing. The behavior always interrupts her study on the IELTS. That’s because her sister met a problem recently. An investment company took money from investors out, and her sister cannot recall the investment from herself. So her father wants to find the related company to recall the money in Beijing.

My girlfriend is anxious about her IELTS test recently. So when she got the message from her sister that claims the uncle will come again, my girlfriend became inpatient and expressed she doesn’t want the uncle comes. Then her sister was angry too, so the sister didn’t talk more with my girlfriend. The terrible situation appeared.

I could understand why they both all feel unhappy with this situation. For my girlfriend's sister, it might like two-year work was stolen. How many two-year time does she have? So I could know why the sister was so angry with my girlfriend’s rejection. On the other hand, I also know that if my girlfriend cannot get an ideal score in IELTS, she may not be able to study aboard. For her, how many opportunities does she has to live out of China? That might be another life.

But I really don’t want to see they both become poisonous to each other. I don’t want to see their binding will be broken. Everyone needs to think about their interest for themselves, but they also need to put themselves to contrary position. The simple difference can not ruin So many years relation. Be a kind person, to understand each other. That’s what we expect to be.
