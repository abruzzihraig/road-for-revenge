### The Chef Has Come Back
Can’t believe that I was coding tonight until 1 a.m. It is unexpected from both of god and myself. It is Saturday night after all. It should have been a wonderful gaming night.

Since I have already sent a long email to my boss tonight, so I won’t write more as writing practice. I cooked again, in this afternoon. Just fired eggs with tomatoes. I know everyone would think this dish is the easiest to cook, but I never did it from I arrived in this land. It’s a good beginning. At least, I have another choice in my recipes.
