### The Eraser That Wipes Bad Memory
I watched the Korean variety show Infinite Challenge tonight. The special edition which I watched is called The Eraser That Wipes Bad Memory. Each MC in the variety show as a psychological counselor to help strange people who have bad memory during their life.

Each MC seated in a temporary tent which located on the busiest street in those prosperous cities. There were few people tried to enter the tent. So they waited for strangers much time until night came. Once a stranger entered in a tent, he/she would be surprised by those famous MCs. Those MCs used their particular ways to help the strangers to speak their regrettable stories, and gave them comfort. There were lots of tears within those stories. It truly touched me.

After the strangers had spoken their regrettable stories, they were recommended to write those bad memory that they regretted. Then they used a special eraser to wipe the words out. The pressure from the memory blew as well.

So I asked myself: What is the worst memory I want to wipe out?

There is always a clear answer for the question. That is the most regrettable story in my lifeâ€”I used to steal cash from my grandma when I was a child. I don't know how many times I watered my tears for the bad memory even today. I don't know if anyone who went through the event could forgive me from their heart. I cannot hold back to regret the silly action from my freaky childhood. I'm not the evil. I don't want to be the man hurts the only one who loves him in the world. I'm so sorry for you, my grandma.
