### Purchasing Broker
It’s too late at this time, I have to take a shower then go bed for tomorrow’s work. So I cannot write much today.

As a free purchasing broker, my dear sister commanded that I need to buy a variety of stuff for her little baby. It was so hot, and the purchase list is so long. I felt shameful when I looted all of goods and suffered despising from surrounding customers. So I told her I won’t help her to buy anything for her friends. Hope she could be considerate to me.
