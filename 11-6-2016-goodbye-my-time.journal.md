### Goodbye My Time
Again, I did nothing today. I took half day to fight with some thorny bosses in Bloodborne. And fortunately, it is almost Platinum Trophy. As for the rest time of the day, I just lied on my bed and looked through my timeline on Zhihu all over again.

I don't know how to get rid of the status of my current life. Even I know which thing is more important to do for my future, I cannot easy to push myself on the stuff. Besides, the PS VR I've preordered will be delivered to my office tomorrow. I'm not sure if I can become better than before.

Ashamed but helpless. Still, I believe someday I finally could find a way to fix them all.
