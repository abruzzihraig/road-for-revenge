### MobX Saves World
Just finished my work at 1:30 a.m. I was so excited about developing the website builder. And then I got my spring from the unassertive but amazing project MobX. It observes your code everywhere, which means you won’t write those shitty boilerplate anymore. Sometimes you even cannot believe such less code could work for a hard effect! It saves your code and your life, and it also worth to make everyone who uses it to invest a cup of coffee to the MobX team.

More observable properties mean you don’t need to write the rough and complicated logic for handling state sync. Most of the time once we had to handle those situations by reassigning a new value to the old portion, it’s more like that you have to pay more time on controlling the way ‘callback’. With MobX, especially the observable way, those verbose and unmaintainable parts will disappear. It just hides the complexity by its magic under the hood, then saves your life.

It worth to try anyway if you want to get free.
