### Dark Souls Make You Despair
So late to write today. That’s because I played Dark Souls 3 whole night.

It might be exceeded 60 hours more I have been playing Dark Souls 3. It always involved me when I play it. That’s rarely happens on other games which I have bought.

Yes, may The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the best RPG game as the masterpiece on 2015. And may the Fallout 4 has the similar reputation too. But I never really addict on them, I mean I can quit them anytime if I have anything else more important should be done. Why the Dark Souls 3 is so attractive for me and for anyone else who has played it?

I have to say the author of Dark Souls, Hidetaka Miyazaki, is an absolutely genius on video game. He can build a particular atmosphere which seems dark and unknown that can make you feel depressed. Every game is trying to fawn you and make you a hero or the centre of the game world, but in Dark Souls, you just a no one and nobody guides you, nobody tells you where should you go and which should you choose. You have to explore everything from every corner of the world and analyse any information on your stuff. Using this way could make you feel true just like the real world.

On the other hand, each monster whatever it is small or big, they are totally powerful. Any small monster can kill you during a few seconds. If you died, you will lost all of your souls (a mixture from both money and experience). Although you have a chance to pick them at where you died, It is not easy to get there without another die. And If you died before get there, you will really lose your souls forever.

That’s why it always make players involved, you have to play it seriously even any step you want to explore. This tension make you focus on it and forget time passing. Along with your skills improving, you will get more real senses of accomplishment. It just like a FC game which we played when we were child, any step would be dangerous, also a died punishment is fearful.

That’s why I am attracted into it. Hidetaka Miyazaki knows what is real essence of game. If you haven’t try it, I strongly recommend it to you.

Good night.
