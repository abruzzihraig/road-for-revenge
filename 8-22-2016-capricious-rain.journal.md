### Capricious Rain
The weather in Melbourne is capricious. You could see both sunshine and rain at the same time. Sometimes in the morning there is hot, while it would be cold in the afternoon.

Today, I have had such a rainy day. At noon, I got up from my chair to have lunch â€” my girlfriend had already cooked for me.

When I opened the office door, the light rain suddenly became heavy. Even if I had a cheap umbrella to prevent the torrential rain drench my clothes. After 7 minutes, when I got home, my pants, my shoes, and even my socks are all wet. No one can predict what weather would be next second. Because after I got in my home, the rain was suddenly stopped.

However, when I prepared to come back to the office, the rain was coming again. I had to change a suit and a pair of boots to avoid drenching one more time.

In the office, my desk is facing a window. During the whole afternoon, I was facing to a bright sunshine without any raindrop. What a capricious rain, no one could explain it.

Finally, when I got off work, the rain came back to a light version again, just like in the morning.

Some people said that you could not predict the weather in Melbourne because any gust of wind will change everything.
