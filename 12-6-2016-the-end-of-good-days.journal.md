### The End Of Good Days
Will tears as the lead is going to back office tomorrow. I will remember those two happy weeks forever when he didn't stay in the office. Thank God gave me those days without him so that I could fish in troubled water and keep relaxing.

For celebrating that we Chinese guys got rid of the lead's control, or maybe I should say the warden's control, we took more than two hours to have a sumptuous lunchâ€”the best Korean fried chicken in Melbourne.

I'm not sure if the next two weeks I will be fine in work, but the good news is Christmas day is coming, and they all will have an extended leave so that maybe I don't have something annoying need to do. But that's just my optimistic hope.

No matter what will come after he backs, I will try my best to live in the jail.
