### Opportunity Or Risk
So tired today, I was working at home until now 2:45 a.m.

Even if I have so many words want to say today, but I have to take a shower then go to bed. Because I have a new challenge. I cannot be defeated by someone.

Yes, I have argued with the leader during the whole morning. And I tried to expose all of his bad parts and the influences he did in the company. The argument was so drastic, I even said If you force me to do the shit, I can quit now.

The leader said,  “If you try to interrupt me any word, you could quite now”.

Hmmm. Interesting. I don’t know this city. I don’t know why this city has such a kind of bad lier in the position where doesn’t belong to him.

Maybe quit is a better choice for me. Who cares the lier?  Hope I can make the new project best.
