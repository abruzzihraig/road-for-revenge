### Useless Man
I know I was involved in games recently. I wasted too much time on them and forgot my original plan. I hope someone could give me a warning. But I know nobody cares it, I have to get them rid off by myself.

Hope I could find a way to change from tomorrow. I need some rules to make myself safe, and I should be responsible for my future life. Improving English and learning techniques are most important things to me, I should use my free time on them.

Also, I suppose maybe I could give a rate for how I spend every day. I don't want to forgive myself again and again. I don't want to be regretful after two or three years. I am still young, but the time during the age is most precious for the whole life.
