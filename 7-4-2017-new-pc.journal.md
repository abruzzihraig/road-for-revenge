### New PC
It is 5 a.m. I took a whole night studying and analysing hardwares for assembling a new PC. The system list has been created by myself, but I still need to be calm to review that list in the next few days. So letâ€™s say goodbye for the new MacBook pro that has price high to $4099, then embrace a strong PC with $3500. The gap could be a Nintendo Switch:) So exciting I am!
