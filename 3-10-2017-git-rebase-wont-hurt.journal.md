### Git Rebase Won’t Hurt
I made an effort tonight on writing how to understand the git merge and git rebase. The Rebase has a deep pitfall in itself. If you want to use it without pain, you have to make sure you had known everything about that before. Figuring out its essence took me so much time until 2 a.m. And that’s why I didn't finish other tasks and why I won’t write more today.

I hope my effort could help whoever met the same issue before.
