### Artist Dream
To be an artist is my dream all the time. I never changed my original interests during these years in a cruel society, although I have to earn money from some shitty works for living.

I love music, I love writing, and I surely love design as well. That’s why I decided to be a front-end programmer when I was learning software engineering in university. I never thought someday the career will be hot, and the related practitioners will be shortage. So that It even make it possible I could live in another country at the moment. Rather than the most of recent front-end guys who just learned from some amateur training courses a few months then try to find a job with high salary.

I chose to be a front-end guy just because I really love the work to show my crafts to others. I like exquisite and high-quality stuffs with rich sense of design. To implement the GUI artworks could satisfy me deeply. That’s why I found a way different to others when my university didn’t have the relative courses.

This year, I don’t know if I am lazy or I am becoming more and more conservative. I even feel boring sometimes when there are a bunch of similar libraries new born but have same principles with before. It is more like a victory of sales rather than to make artworks better. I cannot pay them my passion on, to catch up the new wine in old bottle made me tired and unhappy.

These days I gradually to find some articles about UI design, some artworks were really shocked me. I can’t help to share them to my girlfriend. I try to analyse some details to her to show how the design is excellent in my opinion. Since I don’t have professional knowledges on design, so I always think I don’t have confidence on my comments. Because I am a programmer, I know every career has a huge mountain behind. You can’t just think about them above the surface then give somebody comments irresponsibly.

So I asked my girl, if I am so happy with design rather than tired to catch the boring and similar techniques on front-end, why can’t I try to learn something about design? At least, it should be better than playing games every weekend to me. We all supposed that I should to learn design and to do some artworks by myself. Even though the artworks could be shit, it will make my step to interest closer at least.
