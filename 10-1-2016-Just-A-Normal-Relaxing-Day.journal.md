### Just A Normal Relaxing Saturday
Yes, I squandered a whole day to relax again. I played games, watched some videos on Bilibili. The only one thing significant might be I washed all of dishes which stored in sink a whole week. Cause I found there is no any clean dish when I was ready to cook.

So this is a day just likes yesterday, there should have been nothing worth to record. Yes, it is a normal day until  2 a.m.

I watched a short video on Bilibili when 1:50 a.m. When the end of the video, I noticed the time is 3:13 on my computer. I didn’t realised the time has already changed then. I just thought: Oh! Why the time always flow so quickly? I did nothing but there is already 3 a.m.!

I instinctively began to calculate the time in Beijing should be 1 a.m. Then I found my girlfriend hadn’t go home. So I asked her why she is still be outside, it is so late.

She got home soon then called me. She told me the time in Melbourne was changed today. I will use the daylight saving time from now. That means we used to have a jet leg 2 hours before, but from now to the next winter in Melbourne, that would be 3 hours.

So I just lost one hour from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m.? That is so amazing to me, it’s the first time I go through the time changes. And I have to accept that the jet lag between my girlfriend and myself would be 3 hours. It will give us a little trouble in life.

The weird feeling around me is just a question: Who stole our time? I am still confused about that.
