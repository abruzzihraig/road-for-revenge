### NI-OH Is Amazing
NI-OH is a so awesome game that I was totally involved tonight. I fought with a stack of other gamers in a valley, and tried to steal their armors and weapons. Only the boss at the second stage I cannot defeat so I had to kill more gamers to get the level up.

Another thing is I found a good way to control the state in React, which is called MobX. It is an extremely feasible and convenient architecture for controlling the state by observable pattern. Not similar to Redux, it is only focus on the store and observers, and no more need to learn in MobX.

Have a good weekend.
