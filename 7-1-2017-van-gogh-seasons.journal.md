### Van Gogh Seasons
I’m here just for finishing the diary task. I finally got Van Gogh’s exhibition; it is absolutely amazing. The artworks wrote by him during 1889 - 1890 shock me in mental. You can feel that strong mood from his painting, it just like a black hole will attract your spirit to get you involved in his sad world. And you can’t help to praise how it can be written by a human. They describe a real world looks like a virtual world comes from ghosts’ views.

I’m too tired today to write more. But trust me, Vincent Van Gogh is a legendary painter who worth to cost you all of the money out of your wallet.
