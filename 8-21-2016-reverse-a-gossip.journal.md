### Reverse A Gossip
I’m not a man who likes gossip. But recently there was a funny news broke out everywhere. Chinese actor BaoQiang Wang prepared to divorce with his wife Rong Ma. He said he has enough evidence to prove Rong was derailed with his broker.

The news is breaking out in China, everybody is interested in it. The attention of this news is even higher than Rio Olympics these days. Nobody could explain why so many people like to pay attention on other’s private affair. As for me, I even downloaded a news App 今日头条 to catch the latest news from BaoQiang. Why I am so interested in this gossip? What’s wrong with me? I cannot explain it too. I am just curious about it, and I always want to heard some new stories are extremely bad or incredible.

I just want to see the dark side of humanity. And see it though BaoQiang is more presentative. It would be actually satisfied me.

I don’t know who is right and who has true evidence. The only thing I care about is how deep our online friends could dig on this thing.

The ideal ending I am expected is that BaoQiang is a calculating and manipulative man. He lied everybody with his compassionate letter and he just wanted to divorce with his wife to get a new relation with others. I hope he had known everything before he posted the divorced statement. And I hope he knew the trend of public opinions would be totally controlled by himself. Until a few months or a few years later, someone try to explore the truth of the whole thing. Maybe at that time, all of views from these people today would be broken by the mind shock.

I am really expected a reverse story. God please make it come true.
