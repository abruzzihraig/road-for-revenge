### No More Quarrel
I feel tired about quarrelling with my girlfriend these days. Thought we both were too idle to talk with each other normally. I just want to transfer my focus on something else to forget the quarrel. And also I won’t give her an apology about my rude words. That’s my final self-esteem. Hope her could forget that too.
