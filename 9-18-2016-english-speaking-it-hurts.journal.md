### English Speaking It Hurts
It’s to late to write tonight, so I’ll write less in the journal.

Although I’ve made a plan to practise my writing skills by diarising everyday. There is still an issue about speaking. I don’t have any foreign friends here. And that is not a simple thing to make new friends with them. Because I don’t know their culture, I don’t have a good english skill, so they won’t make a friend with me actually.

I was thinking a whole day about how to solve the situation and how to get rid of the bad circulating. It could be made a plan during this week. At least I have some ideas about that.

For instance, I tried to watch dramas frame by frame to figure out any grammar or any words I didn’t know in every sentence. There were so many slangs made me confused. To finish an episode need double time more. I also tried to speak repeatedly with that. It actually made me hurt.

Wish I could find a better way to practise, I am really want to conquer English someday.
