### Being Tired In Training
I was too tired after finishing the team training today, so I was just sleeping from I came home until midnight. The team training has so many stuff need to learn, we studied from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is the experience I never had in this country before. Now I have to sleep again to embrace a normal late.
