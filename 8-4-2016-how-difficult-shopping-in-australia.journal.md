### How Difficult Shopping In Australia
Today I finally got the desk which I had bought nearly 3 weeks ago. From store! not online.

Can’t believe that everything easy in Beijing but difficult in Melbourne. Especially online shopping and network applying. Those both were hit me deeply here.

Even if I have so many words to complain on network applying, but for the moment, I just want to focus on the online shopping. Describing to you an inefficient flow on online shopping in Australia.

I went to the furniture mall Domayne on 16 of July, with my girlfriend. Fortunately we found a desk has a good price after through a group of expensive woods. Due to my room space is so narrow, I had to back to home to measure if it is acceptable for a new desk.

The next day I decided to buy the desk, so we went to Domayne again. After some conversation I finally paid it. But the elder clerk who was handled my information form, he said the desk is out stock, so they have to pick a new one from their warehouse. ‘Next week, Monday or Tuesday I will call you then you need to come here to pick it up’ the elder said.

Fine, I was waiting.

Monday passed, no one called me.

Tuesday passed, no one called me.

Again, On the Wednesday, I returned to Domayne third time to ask why they didn’t call me. A staff told me the desk has came to the store, I can pick it up then. However, the staff led us to find the desk, but there was no one belonged to us, cause they made a mistake that they picked a wrong type of desk.

So I had to return to home then wait a new one transferring.

After 3 days or so, they gave me a call for notifying me that a new one had been transferred to their store,  would if I want it be delivered to my home freely. Surely I said yes, because the desk is so heavy, if they could deliver it freely, I will absolutely use the service.

Then, I waited 2 weeks.

Even though the distance between the store Domayne to my apartment just about 1 kilometre, it still took 2 weeks to delivery.

And it also took me nearly 3 hours to assemble it, after doing that, I felt I am older then before.

Furthermore, I had bought a Dell monitor P2715Q at the same time from [kogan.com](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/dell-p-series-27-p2715q-led-monitor-dell/). But I am still waiting for it. And Kogan had offered me a $50 git card for their delay.

So missing Beijing, so missing IKEA. Just sharing my tears.
