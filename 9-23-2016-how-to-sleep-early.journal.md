### How To Sleep Early
My girlfriend persuaded that I should sleep early everyday, because sleeping late will make me unhealthy and depressed. Actually, I think so, but that is a really difficult task for me.

I always procrastinate those important and complex things. For example, wash dishes, write a journal, and take a shower. Once I feel one thing need much time to do, then I get scary, because I don’t want to assign my free time on it. I am just lazy, and I want to get more free time after the busy and tired work.

The bad habit has influenced myself from my childhood. Sometimes I even suppose that’s why I am looked older then others who have same age with me.

If I slept late a whole week, then I will be irritable. After I read some articles about that, I did realise the truth of why I am always angry with some irrelevancies.

So yes, she is right, and I am totally applauding to her. But that is not easy for me, I am a guy who like stay waking up before sleeping, then stay sleeping before waking up. The bad cycle could make me get more time after a few weeks. And I know it also could ruin my health.

If I want to be responsible for my family, my friends, and my girlfriend. I have to change the bad habit from now. I wish my girlfriend could supervise me, if I sleep late again, then I have to buy something as gifts to her.

Hope I could get high-quality sleep everyday.
