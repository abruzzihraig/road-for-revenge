        <div class="content">
            <p>What an exciting tonight! I killed the boss Yhorm of Dark Souls 3 just now. No one knows what a nervous experience I had.</p>
<p>The first time I started opening the Yhorm’s door, I noticed Onion Knight is not in there. That made me realised maybe I lost something important within extension storys. So I had to be killed by Yhorm. I was so heart-broken, because I left more than 40,000 souls in there. That means if I want to pick them up, I have to walk to anywhere without using bonfire to quickly transfer.</p>
<p>By searching some useful gaming strategies of Dark Souls 3, I finally found that I forgot to save Onion Knight out of prison. So I have to kill every enemy with a great care to get the prison.</p>
<p>Onion Knight is a fat man sit on the floor in prison. Through into a window, he told me that I need to find a key first. Actually I had already got the key then, but I don’t know where is the door to use the key.</p>
<p>At that time, I was lost in the complex map again. Since I cared about those souls left nearby Yhorm, I had to kill anyone on my way. I nearly killed all of enemies in the whole underground prison! That takes me so much time because I have to be careful when fighting with them. If I died, all of souls would be lost. Besides, I also need save my limited blood bottles.</p>
<p>Finally I found the secret road to get the door of Onion Knight’s room. Onion Knight gave me a best stone to enhance my sword after I unlocked the door.</p>
<p>After that, I started to fight Yhorm again. But I was so careless at this time. When I walked to the Yhorm’s room, I didn’t equip the sword Storm, which is efficient to kill Yhorm. So I had to let Onion Knight facing Yhorm alone, but I was trying to find and equip the sword Storm.</p>
<p>However, even though I was trying my best to equip the Storm fast, Onion Knight still died. I picked up the souls, with addition of new income, it reached to 100,000 souls. After received a few attacks, I was died due to I didn’t have enough supply.</p>
<p>What a sad story! I have to do the same thing again! But Onion Knight has been dead.</p>
<p>Fine, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm. Because I didn’t know how to use a specific skill of the sword Storm, I didn’t know which button should I press.</p>
<p>Never mind, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm, again. Even if he just left the final blow to be died. I nearly screamed then.</p>
<p>I need a little lucky, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. At this time, the worst situation was appeared. I can’t believe that I was died by coming down from a bridge. That means I lost all of souls near the Yhorm.</p>
<p>With a sad breast, I tried it again. This time I finally killed Yhorm, just with few bottles of supply. But so what? I have already lost 100,000 souls and so much time tonight. My mood has already been unhappy. Even though the game is actually exciting, but it was not satisfied me indeed tonight.</p>

            <p>Even though I never thought I was a geek, for the revenge of writing journals, I have to admit I devoted some efforts on it to make the whole plan works better. It even has a little bit funny.</p>
<p>I’ve created a new repository <a href="https://github.com/abruzzihraig/DayOneFlow" target="_blank" rel="external">DayOneFlow</a>, which is my personal workflow for writing journals easier. Since I am a programmer, I have to develop something to reducing insignificant time using. That’s my main purpose to create the repo.</p>
<p>The script is available for normal compiling and deploying, but it still need to update for more essential requirements. I will finish it these days if I have free time. Soon or later I will write a technical journal to record how it works. But today, let us ignore it.</p>
<p>In late today, I tried an excellent app <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grammarly</a>, which is an English grammar checking tool. It could help you find any typo or grammar issue by analyzing your articles. It is awesome especially when you got a premium version. The premium version could give you more advanced advice, and it also calculates a score according to your post. But It’s really expensive, more than $130 per year. Hope it’s worthy.</p>
<p>I tried to modify a post Cozy Space by the Grammarly App. It just gave me 55 scores with lots of issues on right side of the post. I nearly took half hours to make everything right for its check. Indeed I learned many details that I have already known but not pay attention to.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hope we can improve our knowledges everyday.</p>

            <p>Today I eventually got the 4K monitor! It took nearly one month to delivery. The waiting is hard for me. In Australia, we have to face the truth that receiving date depends on how many mistakes would be made by those service providers. That means you need luckiness to wait and do not overly concern about it.</p>
<p>No matter what at least I’ve got them. It makes me happy, and everything is simple and neat. With the melodious music from the Stanmore Speaker, I stay relaxing. I never feel good on jazz, but now, this kind of music is soft and lazy, it makes me remind a lonely game Fallout 4. There are many radios in it play different jazz music around by you, and your dog.</p>
<p>There still are something lack. I need to put a new touchpad at home for avoiding take many accessories between home and office. For preventing someday I lost touchpad at home, I need a new one. Besides, I also have 2 of $50 coupons could reduce on that. Another I want is a floor lamp beside my desk. I plan to buy it from IKEA after my girlfriend left.</p>
<p>As for the new monitor, I was worried about if my computer could use the so high-resolution screen. Due to my MacBook was released in late 2013, it doesn’t have an individual graphics, and the integrated graphics might not afford the high resolution.</p>
<p>After trying it with my MacBook, as expected, It has low performance on some kinds of ratios. But if I scale it as a standard ratio(1920x1080) or as a more space ratio(3840x2160), it is fast just like my MacBook itself. Even if sometimes I might scale the rate to a low-performance state, I suppose it is enough for coding or watching videos.</p>
<p>I also tried the 4k monitor with PS4. But It is disappointing, because PS4 just supports 1080P, it can’t reach the 4k resolution. Moreover, I cannot set the speaker to PS4, that means I have to use a headset on my game handler, I cannot bear it.</p>
<p>How cozy space for me, this one square meter is enough. I have the Internet to find everything I am interested. I have an iPhone, an iPad and a Macbook, they are all best smart devices in this world, look exquisite and high-quality. I have a 4K monitor with a high-resolution screen, and that means I could get a huge space on it, or I won’t see any distinct pixel point anymore. I have both of the best small keyboards, they are same but different, just like a pair of brothers. I have a good speaker and a comfortable headset. They are all come from Marshall, which is the most famous company to produce speakers for rockers. I could use Spotify, Google, and every best app or online service if I want. No more walls like in China. That makes me feel free.</p>

            <p>Sorry to guys again. These days I was so busy from every morning to night. Hope you would understand. To be honest I didn’t write journals these days, even though I have so much words to say. Let me implement them this week. If you want to request me money for my promise, you can just say it to me. Or give me some time to finish them recently.</p>
<p>I don’t want to cope with the journal, but I have really no time today to say a full story, cause I have to get up early tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thanks guys, I’ll return 3 good articles to you.</p>

            <p>Actually I have a lots of things want to be recorded today. But sorry for guys, I am too busy this evening. I handled many things before I have time to write here. And now is 2:12 a.m. I will also get up early tomorrow to catch up an airplane for travel.</p>
<p>Yes I have a travel with my girlfriend from tomorrow to Sunday. The destination is Gold Coast. I guess there must be an awesome place for vacation.</p>
<p>For the trip, I spent so much time tonight, and I also won’t bring my computer to there. That means maybe I can not deploy my new journals to Github. So I just want to ask for a leave, hope you guys could forgive me. Sure I also could write journal on my iPhone. There is an amazing app called Day One. It supports all of platforms, and I even spent 128 RMB for getting a Mac version.</p>
<p>I will take lots of photos on my next three journals, it shouldn’t be disappointing for you guys, trust me!</p>
<p>Today I implemented an important work on the plan Road For Revenge. That is I built the static blog for those journals. It should be looked more professional and serious, Might you guys hope so. I took some time tonight on it as well, to change some code on layouts, change some styles for my specific requirements. For now it is simple and enough to myself.</p>
<p>The most difficult part is also what I want to record here to discuss with you. That is how I could make the whole process below easier:</p>
<p>Writing journal on Day One, then copy it and wrap with markdown syntax to the master branch on the repository Road For Revenge. After that, using commend <code>hexo new post ‘title’</code> to create a post template in hexo engine, then copy the journal which is markdown version to the post template. Finally deploying the new post to Github Pages for updating the blog.<br>Furthermore, If there is any issue has been reported, then I have to fix it among those 3 different ways.</p>
<p>This process is holy shit. I don’t have so much time could be used for those insignificant and what things are easy to make mistakes. I have some ideas on program, but sorry guys I don’t have enough time to say it today. If you have any idea please discuss with me, that would be interesting.</p>
<p>See you guys next Monday!</p>

            <p>Since I worked here there is always a guy everyday I can see in the park, in which I have to get through to my office.</p>
<p>The guy seems mysterious. He always sits on the same bench which back to road. No matter how strong wind, no matter how dense cloud, every morning when I walk nearby the bench, I always could see the guy’s back, the guy’s hat and the guy’s hands are rubbing.</p>
<p>He always looks like a man who is thinking, he doesn’t care about anyone through the road, just shows them his back and his indifferent style.</p>
<p>Sometimes he read some books on the bench, if felt cold he would rub his hands constantly. Other times, I also noticed he brought some weird musical instruments. Fiddled with these instruments but I am sure he didn’t play them. He used a microphone on a stand to record the timbre from his instruments. No one actually knew what he was doing, but I suppose he was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Actually I have a little bit admired on this guy. Living like a kind of artist, even though he might have nothing to proud, and nobody knows him. At least he knows what he have done and what he is doing. Don’t care about other people’s mind, then enjoy the relaxing life.</p>

            <p>How strong windy today! I was going to take my girlfriend shopping today, for celebrating the festival Double Seventh. However it was so regretful, the strong wind saved my wallet.</p>
<p>For the festival, I got off work early today, maybe after half past four pm. I had already at home.</p>
<p>Honestly I just wanted to get more time to play Dark Souls these days, but I supposed if I played the game just after work, without company to my girlfriend, I will take more time to coax her at a whole night.</p>
<p>So I decided to cook for her today. Unfortunately I just can cook a few dishes, and I actually don’t have enough experience to make them better. Finally my pitiful girlfriend had to eat something simple and easy to cook: first is fired rice with eggs and hams, second is beef with chilli. Yes the both are my best dishes.</p>
<p>Fired rice was nice thus nothing to criticise, it should be perfect I suppose. As for the beef with chilli, I forgot the right order to cook them separately. So I had to fire them three times while it still tasted tasteless even though I had already put so much salt. For saving it, I also put lots of peppers on it. Hoped my girlfriend could excuse my poor cooking skill.</p>
<p>If some food cooked by yourself, even though they taste bad, you will eat them up. Might that’s why home cooking is better than outsider.</p>

            <p>Before I left Beijing, I had never bought any chilli sauce. Even if I really like a course named Rice with Godmother when I was learning in university. I can even eat the same one more than 3 months.</p>
<p>But when I came in Melbourne, something has changed in my mind. The first thing I had noticed is that Godmother is so well-known and sold all around the world. You can easily find Godmother in any Asian market.</p>
<p>Eating out is usually expensive, so most of people are used to cooking at home. Of course one of the reasons is we have enough time after work here. Therefore I nearly cook everyday. That’s why I started to suppose how incredible the Godmother is.</p>
<p>Without the Godmother chilli sauce, you’ll always feel there is some kind of flavours missing. Because salt and pepper just can improve salty, but if you try to put some chilli, it actually make you feel hot rather than spicy. In the moment you need going to find another liberator, Godmother.</p>
<p>Godmother can make any food be a delicacy, it has some kind of magic on cooking. I’ve already used it to rescue my terrible cooking many times. And it always works. You can’t believe that I just came here 3 months but I have got 4 bottles of Godmother for different flavours.</p>
<p>Besides, there also is a snack we called it spicy article in China. When I lived in China, I never eat it cause it looks unhealthy and cheap. But trust me guys, if you got another country more then 1 month, and you find the snack spicy article someday, your tears will pouring down.</p>
<p>Thanks Godmother and WeiLong, you both saved my taste scene.</p>

            <p>What a tired day! We have been shopping on IKEA a whole day. By the tram 109, way to eastward, it took half hour we finally got there.</p>
<p>The IKEA in Melbourne is smaller then in Beijing. But actually most of goods are same, you can find words ‘MADE IN CHINA’ anywhere. Also you can find some familiar Chinese words on lots of packages.</p>
<p>We like to buy something which can actually improve our life style. And thanks to IKEA, for its price and consistency on design. I found so many baubles and convenient stuffs which  could satisfy me, especially those goods which could make home more warm. For example, scented candle could make you relax, floor lamp with my wooden desk would be harmony and neat, small storage boxes could take advantage of any narrow space around my bed.</p>
<p>Yes I like the feeling that anything could use all of space exactly, but still keeping consistency visually. I can finally put my iPhone or iPad or something else like remote controls to those storage boxes around my bed. I can’t believe how I could stand them drop down to floor through a narrow gap between bed and wall again and again. Do you know what is the worst thing when I get up? It’s just when I want to close my alarm but accidentally my phone dropped down through the gap. Oh my glasses as well. The terrible scene will destroy my mood in the morning. I’d rather than buy some useful stuffs to avoid this scene.</p>
<p>Sure, the most difficult part is compose those complex furniture, such as cabinet or desk. Yes I spent an hour more again to DIY those complex stuffs. For me it just like to build LEGO but it might make your finger pain. My girlfriend always call me repairman, that’s not without reason.</p>
<p>Tired but happy, hope my environment could be more cosy.</p>

            <p>So late to write today. That’s because I played Dark Souls 3 whole night.</p>
<p>It might be exceeded 60 hours more I have been playing Dark Souls 3. It always involved me when I play it. That’s rarely happens on other games which I have bought.</p>
<p>Yes, may The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the best RPG game as the masterpiece on 2015. And may the Fallout 4 has the similar reputation too. But I never really addict on them, I mean I can quit them anytime if I have anything else more important should be done. Why the Dark Souls 3 is so attractive for me and for anyone else who has played it?</p>
<p>I have to say the author of Dark Souls, Hidetaka Miyazaki, is an absolutely genius on video game. He can build a particular atmosphere which seems dark and unknown that can make you feel depressed. Every game is trying to fawn you and make you a hero or the centre of the game world, but in Dark Souls, you just a no one and nobody guides you, nobody tells you where should you go and which should you choose. You have to explore everything from every corner of the world and analyse any information on your stuff. Using this way could make you feel true just like the real world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, each monster whatever it is small or big, they are totally powerful. Any small monster can kill you during a few seconds. If you died, you will lost all of your souls (a mixture from both money and experience). Although you have a chance to pick them at where you died, It is not easy to get there without another die. And If you died before get there, you will really lose your souls forever.</p>
<p>That’s why it always make players involved, you have to play it seriously even any step you want to explore. This tension make you focus on it and forget time passing. Along with your skills improving, you will get more real senses of accomplishment. It just like a FC game which we played when we were child, any step would be dangerous, also a died punishment is fearful.</p>
<p>That’s why I am attracted into it. Hidetaka Miyazaki knows what is real essence of game. If you haven’t try it, I strongly recommend it to you.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
