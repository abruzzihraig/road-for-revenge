            <p>Sorry again, it is too late to write for me. I am so sleepy now.</p>
<p>I watched an old movie The Call Of Cthulhu tonight. It was made at 2005, but it was directed with old techniques as 1900. So the movie is black-white and silent.</p>
<p>I watched the movie just want to know the background of the game Bloodbourne. Each game from Hidetaka Miyazaki is extremely obscure, so we have to know more from the background, to know how Hidetaka Miyazaki thinks.</p>
<p>The movie actually looks a little bit boring. It just describes an archaeologist found some clues to confirm the cult was living, the god was existing, and anyone who knew that would be died. I think it might be the first time using recursive memories from different people on fiction. So maybe that’s why it is a classic to Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>
<p>No matter what, Bloodbourne is another excellent game just like Darksouls. Let me live with my sorrow.</p>

            <p>At first, I have to celebrate that finally I got the platinum trophy at tonight. During nearly 300 hours the gaming time, I was really enjoyable. DarkSouls taught me lots of things. The most impressing point to me is that it taught me how to figure out a way to defeat any invincible enemy.</p>
<p>I will never forget the happy and the nervous memories. Treating any enemy equally is a philosophy of the series of DarkSouls, it also warns us we have to be serious to any challenge in our future life.</p>
<p>Another thing is I made a flag today. And it obviously is a bad result to me.</p>
<p>My boss was discussing with our clients these days in Tokyo. He showed our project KDP to them to sell. In the morning, he sent an email to us, and he said he felt we haven’t minified our front-end code in the demo server.</p>
<p>Then I replied confidently that we have already minified code since the first released version. I vowed it with multiple web optimised features that we’ve already done. I even said I thought our project has an industry standard on web performance. I showed him two more optimising ways like CDN or make 3rd-party libraries chunked, and I told him I think the current performance is enough for this phase or just the demo. No one need to worry about it.</p>
<p>After I showed my knowledges off, I tried to rethink why he thought the code hadn’t been minified. I saw the final file after handled by UglifyJS and some other optimised plugins, it was nearly could not be read. However, I noticed there were so many variables hadn’t been mingled. It is so weird.</p>
<p>I took much time on it to find why the variables cannot be mingled by UglifyJS. Finally I knew from the document of UglifyJS that it cannot mingle code from ‘eval’ expression in Javascript. Yes, our final compressed file used the ‘eval’ expression with a property ‘devtool’ on the webpack config. The property ‘devtool’ shouldn’t be there when we using ‘dist’ mode to compile the final code for production environment.</p>
<p>That’s a totally mistake was made by myself. It made me so ashamed, especially when I saw the actually minified and mingled code after I fixed the problem.</p>
<p>So I decided to say sorry to my boss about that. Hope he could forgive my stupid words.</p>
<p>This experience taught me do not make a flag if you haven’t to investigate a problem. Otherwise, if you are wrong, the shame will always be with you.</p>

<p>I attempted the Angular2 celebrating meetup with my friends. But actually, there was no any attractive thingy during the speech. We just got some pizzas and beers as a dinner.</p>
<p>The speech just took us less than half hour, and there were two guys introduced that Angular2 had been released and where can we learn it. The second guy is an Indian. I cannot understand most of words from his mouth. Dude, please forgive me.</p>
<p>So, that is a boring meetup again. Hope someday I could meet a better one, and hope I could speak more smoothly to foreigners then.</p>

            <p>Our boss showed the KDP project to the clients in Sydney today. And they said the work is awesome and brilliant. Yes, we should celebrate for ourselves.</p>
<p>So we just need to ensure the service stable when our boss shows the KDP to clients in Tokyo at tomorrow morning. Hope everything is fine for the present.</p>
<p>There was a melody around my head tonight. It is a song from Coldplay, but I don’t know what is its name. It made me remind that I am still a music lover. I cannot live if there is no music in my life.</p>
<p>I tried to find what is the name of the song. I listened songs one by one in Coldplay’s albums from Spotify. Each of the songs made me remind so much in my past life. There were some memorises were sticked by those songs. Any piece of the songs had been associated with my happy or sad moments. They all are the evidences of my truly living.</p>
<p>Finally, I figured out the song. It named ‘Swallowed In The Sea’. Just like a kind of song by humming. Chris Martin has an angelic voice, so that’s why the song could touch us deeply, even if it is just humming.</p>
<p>I miss my guitar and my youth. Wish I can get my guitar back to here when next time I returned to China.</p>

            <p>Still be a busy day. We front-end guys kept high tension on our urgent tasks today until we showed the whole AD creating process to our boss.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, It failed a few times with the unstable API from sever when our boss checked it. That really made me disappointed. Cause we’ve already done our best on it. But how can we make others be responsible to their work?</p>
<p>I suppose there is no way to force some people better. But there is one thing I could do is that I won’t follow them any second in my life. Wish someday I could find some better colleagues and friends who have a similar worldview with me. Let’s do some really high-quality things in our rest life.</p>

<p>So there is nothing could to record, because I need sleep as early as I can. We will keep busy until the Thursday. That’s because our boss need to show the product to our clients in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I need to practise my English more, not just write a simple journal. I need to read some new technical news rather than to play PS4 everyday. I’ve been playing the Dark Souls more than 240 hours! How shame I am. I should have got a target if I used the 240 hours to anything.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if tomorrow I am still bad like these days. But I really wish anyone could warn me strictly. Cause the self-discipline make us better. If we can’t keep ourselves self-discipline, we should try to make a price to our friends for our promises. That might be another choice.</p>

            <p>Yes, I squandered a whole day to relax again. I played games, watched some videos on Bilibili. The only one thing significant might be I washed all of dishes which stored in sink a whole week. Cause I found there is no any clean dish when I was ready to cook.</p>
<p>So this is a day just likes yesterday, there should have been nothing worth to record. Yes, it is a normal day until  2 a.m.</p>
<p>I watched a short video on Bilibili when 1:50 a.m. When the end of the video, I noticed the time is 3:13 on my computer. I didn’t realised the time has already changed then. I just thought: Oh! Why the time always flow so quickly? I did nothing but there is already 3 a.m.!</p>
<p>I instinctively began to calculate the time in Beijing should be 1 a.m. Then I found my girlfriend hadn’t go home. So I asked her why she is still be outside, it is so late.</p>
<p>She got home soon then called me. She told me the time in Melbourne was changed today. I will use the daylight saving time from now. That means we used to have a jet leg 2 hours before, but from now to the next winter in Melbourne, that would be 3 hours.</p>
<p>So I just lost one hour from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m.? That is so amazing to me, it’s the first time I go through the time changes. And I have to accept that the jet lag between my girlfriend and myself would be 3 hours. It will give us a little trouble in life.</p>
<p>The weird feeling around me is just a question: Who stole our time? I am still confused about that.</p>

            <p>There were some bad things on work made me unhappy today. The backend guys didn’t sync the public API server with the latest developing API server. They left quickly from office without any message to us.</p>
<p>Actually, more than half delayed tasks were blocked by the backend API. I don’t know why those guys are so irresponsible on their work. Last week we had already met the same situation, the public server was not a newest version. That took us two more hours on releasing process to prevent the side effects from the legacy API.</p>
<p>Never mind, they give me money and the VISA, that is the only way reliable for me to America someday. So let them go, just keeping the technical faith to myself.</p>
<p>For getting rid of the unpleasant memory, I played the Dark Souls 3 a whole night. It is worth mentioning that this is the third time I replayed the game. So you guys could know how much free time I have during the half year.</p>
<p>Since the Dark Souls 3 has already made me feel bored, so after killed two bosses I closed it immediately. I would have watched a drama to instead of. But before I switched to Netflix, there was an idea came out: why don’t try the game I bought yesterday? That is the game The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>I would have decided to take five minutes on it, but from the beginning of the game, I was totally involved in. The Last Of Us just likes a movie, it has extremely strong appeal. Every detail on character voices and BGM are pretty attractive. Each frame on the game could be a nice photograph. It seems a little bit similar to Uncharted 4.</p>
<p>However, the most impressing part to me is the story itself. I just played it less than two hours, and I am not sure if the further story is still interesting. But so far, it just seems like the drama Walking Dead to me. I enjoyed the time when I play it.</p>
<p>The most important thing I forget to say, tomorrow is a holiday in Melbourne, so that I could have three free days to stay at home. However, I’m not sure if I will do something insignificant on the three-day holiday. I wish I could remind  my girlfriend’s name after the holiday.</p>
