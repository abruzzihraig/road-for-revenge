            <p>These days I ate outside. In general I always choose the Korean restaurant at the corner of the street nearby our office. As I am an adamant guy, so I always choose the same number one of their menu.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also choose to eat some Chinese food in a Guangdong restaurant which named Meiguiyuan, it located behind a street of my home. Although the fast food is easy to solve hungry, and it could save so much time on cooking, I still want to cook If I have time.</p>
<p>On the one hand, cooking by myself could save some money. On the other hand, It also makes my life interesting and significant. I actually enjoy the cooking time.</p>
<p>Today, when I was opening my refrigerator, I saw a bag of gyoza in the frozen box. So I decided to fry them. That’s my first time to fry something on a saucepan.</p>
<p>I called my girlfriend, and I wanted to got some help from her. I put my mobile on a shelf, so she could watch what will I do on the stove.</p>
<p>I was listening to her wisdom, while I poured some oil to the saucepan. But the oil looked a little less. Once I put any dumpling on the pan, it doesn’t have enough oil to wrap dumplings, so the first few dumplings were totally pasted.</p>
<p>I realised the problem immediately, so I did some preparation before the second batch. I defrosted the rest dumplings first, then I poured more oil on the pan. When the pan was not heated too hot, I put the second batch immediately. So that it could prevent the oil breaking out with the ice on those dumplings.</p>
<p>This time I could easily wrap oil on each of dumplings. Since there was a small fire, so I have enough time to turn over every one. Finally they all got a same golden colour.</p>
<p>As for the result, I have to say that is the best gyoza I have ever eaten in this country. Thanks for the assistance from my girlfriend. She made me enjoyable on each boring day.</p>

            <p>I am always a paranoid guy from my childhood. Sometimes it made me full confidence to challenge the unfair world. Sometimes it swallowed my emotion to make me depressed.</p>
<p>There is a phrase in Chinese means when you realised something is bad, and you want to change it to right, do not overexert to make it bad again. This is the few word I often recall in my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes this feeling is like playing racing games. If you want to turn right, you shouldn’t turn the steering wheal to the rightmost. Otherwise, you might get a circle in the same place. If you want to drive more fast and more smooth, you have to control the direction slightly. In our real life, it just like balancing your mood and status when you got an important challenge.</p>
<p>We all will meet some challenges just belong to us someday, whether we could achieve the final victory it depends on what strategy we want to choose. For me and for now, the key question which confused me is how to balance the mentality, to prevent me overexert on something specifically, to make myself get a global view.</p>
<p>My paranoid character is also influencing my close friends, especially my girlfriend. It often make them hurt, and it also make me guilty. Hope I could handle those challenges in my life peacefully, without any hurt on anyone at any time.</p>

            <p>I was effective today, I was happy and nothing blocked me on my work until 5 p.m.</p>
<p>My last task is to implement a feature that could use two buttons to control the order of objects which drawing in a Canvas stack. It should be easy to achieve, I even thought it just need to take me 5 minutes.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. I met an annoying issue when I was trying to develop it. The problem is when a user selected an object, for example an image on the canvas, the object will be the front of all of objects. That was unexpected. Because if the user has already selected an object, then he/she won’t see the changes when the two layer buttons are clicked. The selected object will stay at the top of all of objects until the selection is cleared.</p>
<p>I don’t want users cannot see the changing process when they clicked the layer buttons then suddenly get a result they don’t want when the selection is released.</p>
<p>I have used the underlying library Fabric.js, and I know it shouldn’t have this behaviour as default. So I have absolute confidence to consider there are a couple lines of code control this logic in our plugin code. Actually, the plugin code is purchased from a plugin platform, and it has a bad quality. I have to read them painfully to add new features.</p>
<p>However, I nearly took 2 hours on finding where are those code. I don’t know what is the key API method on that, so I have to read the code line by line. It made me angry.</p>
<p>After this 2-hour boring barren work, I became to think if it is a default behaviour in the latest version of the underlying library Fabric.js. I tried a demo immediately on the JSFiddle, and it is indeed a default behaviour.</p>
<p>You cannot find the new change on their documents, and you may also won’t see how to control the behaviour by a parameter if no one posted an issue. What the fucking kidding, it took me 2 hours! I should be at home and doing my personal affairs.</p>
<p>The shitty work ruined my good mood.</p>

            <p>I helped my girlfriend to modify her article of a design work.</p>
<p>But we were not pleased. Because after I fixed some issues in her English, I found there were no any sentence in Chinese part is correct. That made me unhappy, because I thought she was irresponsible for her work.</p>
<p>She doesn’t have a good English skill just like me. So she did the Chinese notes first, then she tried to translate them to English. But translating Chinese to English literally is not a wise solution. Because they have some differences on the grammar.</p>
<p>I thought we could implement the Chinese part first. But we have to ensure the Chinese part has whole logic and appearance, and any user could feel the main purpose from the words. A good article should make everyone knows what is the author wants to describe.</p>
<p>However, when I focused on her Chinese part, I can’t believe my girlfriend wrote just like a nine-year-old child. The Chinese grammar errors were exposed everywhere. The logic has so many critical faults. Some words are repetitive, especially the subject word ‘I’ and some useless conjunctions.</p>
<p>It cannot make sense easily, a thousand people could have a thousand views on her article. That is what I cannot acceptable! Because the article is about her design work for applying a university. That’s why I was so angry, because that is a really important thing about her life and for her future. She cannot be so irresponsible on her life, I dislike that.</p>
<p>Although I was critical of her article, and she was upset as well, I still want to make her realising how to make things better and how to make matters professional. There is only a  kind of person I admire, that is dedicated themselves to each important thing.</p>

            <p>I spent a whole day to watch the latest released drama Narcos season 2. I can’t help to recommend it to my friends. Because it is really brilliant as it based on a real-life event.</p>
<p>The Netflix could be the best drama platform. Even though I have a bad network in Melbourne, it still supports me a high-quality video. On the other hand, the Netflix has already released some popular dramas, such as Narcos, House of Cards, Making a murderer, etc. All of these dramas are very agreeable to me.</p>
<p>I am using the Netflix App on PlayStation for now. Cause I don’t have an Apple TV or a Chromecast yet. Actually, the version of PlayStation is good enough for me. It even has a traditional Chinese subtitle!</p>
<p>Most of conversations in this drama Narcos are Spanish. I am painful if I am listening to Spanish and watching to English subtitles. So the traditional Chinese is really helped me.</p>
<p>Just like the Game of Thrones, from the episode 1 - 5 are foreshadowings. After that, each part will make you astonished. You may feel amazing on how the event could be true. You won’t believe it could be happened in the real world. A drug dealer could have so many authorities, he could control everything in his country, it includes an amy and a government. No one can prevent him in that period.</p>
<p>I don’t want to expose too much content from it. But I really sure I was shocked by it. It has a compact story, and it’s ups and downs. Sometimes you need to hold your breath to watch it, because you don’t know who will be the next died person.</p>
<p>I really want to recommend it to you guys. Good night.</p>

            <p>We got some stage victories today. That is we have released the first version of KDP publisher portal. It should have a celebration in the evening, but we guys were tired, and we just wanted to back to home, to sleep or to play games.</p>
<p>I finally got a rest tonight. The Dark Souls makes me relaxing at home. I don’t know if there are still some busy workdays are waiting for me this month. But I just want to make a rest at this weekend. I just want to play games, and have a good sleep.</p>
<p>The first version has good responses by our colleagues, I think so. Cause I took so much time on it these days, and I swear I have already tried my best on it. </p>
<p>Actually, I was worried about if our colleagues actually know what we did. So I wrote a detailed change logs on the first version. Hope everyone could know what is the actual front-end project and what is the professional engineering way. And hope our boss could know how long we need to develop a professional front-end website.</p>
<p>The worry seems like that if a child got 100 points, he/she will be considered an excellent guy. If a child got 60 points, he/she will be considered an eligible guy. But if a child take some efforts then get 80 or 90 points, most of people still suppose the guy is eligible. Even though the child has already tried his/her best on it.</p>
<p>My colleagues always told me they don’t need a good work, they don’t need any beautiful code, If a customer said it doesn’t need change, we don’t need to do anything. So that I don’t need so much time on work. That is what I really hate. I don’t want to make myself stoop, even if in this relaxing country. I believe someday I finally could find some guys who have the same intentions with me, then we could build some actually valuable and significant arts for our life and for the world.</p>
<p>That’s all, let me play in the whole night!</p>

            <p>I swear I have already tried my best to develop the new project KDP. But I still scare that no one supports me on those work. Never mind, I just need one month to confirm my points and values. If we still get a same situation on such small startup after that, I will quit without any regret.</p>
<p>Today I finished an important work, that is making a professional project procedure. After tried some project management tools, finally I find there is no good project management app online.</p>
<p>I’ve tried Asana, Trello and Teambition. Actually they three are the widely accepted management tools. But I think they still have their individual defects.</p>
<p>Trello is more similar to a to-do list. It doesn’t have a calendar to make a global plan on a project.</p>
<p>Asana is good, and I really like their design. They have the best front-end guys and the excellent designers. But for interacting with team members, it has a little complex. There is no way just like making to-do list cards directly on it. So the procedure for developers might not good as Trello or Teambition.</p>
<p>Among of these tools, the Teambition should be the best. But unfortunately, the Teambition has some bugs recently, and it has bad network in Australia.</p>
<p>So that I tried to find another one for making a project procedure better.</p>
<p>Finally I found it. That is a Mac app OmniPlan. It is so expensive that I have to use a cracked version.</p>
<p>I used it to create a whole month plan on our project. I could make different phases on it. Then I could specify a time on each task. After that, I could assign a developer on those tasks.</p>
<p>After made the whole procedure, the OmniPlan could export all kinds of reports, especially the Gantt, that is the best graph for me to know every detailed part in our plan.</p>
<p>Hope my colleagues doesn’t have any enmity on my work. All of I did just want to help this startup grows bigger and more professional. Please do not think I will take the bread out of your mouth. I don’t have such a great plan on such a small company.</p>
<p>So wronged I am.</p>
<p>Try my best then wait for destiny.</p>

            <p>Just like yesterday, busy and tired, I was coding until now(2:20 AM).</p>
<p>I have nothing to say today, and I just want to sleep now. Hope the project process could be controlled. Tomorrow, I need make a whole month plan for the project too. Because no one knows how we made efforts these days.</p>
<p>Ignore today’s journal, Give me some time to take a bath. Thanks.</p>
