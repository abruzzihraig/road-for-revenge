            <p>I watched the drama Shameless yesterday until 6 a.m. So I woke up late today.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, there was already two o’clock. And my friend Ryan asked me in Wechat if he could come here to have a discussion with me for his project.</p>
<p>’Oh! Why you didn’t tell me yesterday!’ I replied frighteningly. That means I need to take more than two hours to clean the room before he comes in.</p>
<p>So that I told him he could come to my home after 4 p.m. Then I started to clean immediately.</p>
<p>I washed the toilet with detergent, but the brush has some oil on it. So I had to flush it many times until there is no oil float on water surface.</p>
<p>After that, I folded my bed against the wall. So that there were more space could make a guest feel spacious.</p>
<p>I also used a vacuum cleaner to clean every corner on the floor. Thanks for its battery, it actually could finish the whole cleaning work with me at this important time.</p>
<p>Took shower, washed dishes, Took out the trash, hide clothes and socks. I even don’t have a lunch during the busy cleaning work. I didn’t eat anything nearly one day(so I was very hungry when I discussed with him).</p>
<p>When the work almost finished, he rang the doorbell. What a hurry process! But at least I did it, that was really made me pleasant.</p>

            <p>We front-end team tried to integrate with API service today. But we failed, because there are some mechanisms I was not familiar, especially the authentication and authorisation parts.</p>
<p>We used OAuth 2.0 framework as the authorisation mechanism. That means we front-end team just need keep an access token to fetch any data from our resource server. I never used the OAuth before, even though I’ve known that is popular in everywhere.</p>
<p>I thought it should be easy, so I tried to analyse code from previous projects. I knew if we use OAuth, we have to write code according to a right format, but I didn’t know what is the actual interaction between an App and an Auth Server.</p>
<p>Nothing broke my mind when I was thinking how the authorisation is handled between an App and a server. I even found a perfect logic to explain how it works, and I also told that for my team member. Another backend colleague agreed with me as well.</p>
<p>However, I paid one hour to read the RFC document of OAuth 2.0 in the evening. Then I found I was totally wrong. Every parts I reasoned is incorrect. I made so many jokes on it. That made me really shamed.</p>
<p>I should have read the RFC document before I taught others. It just needs one hour to read the basic usage and the whole authentication architecture. Then I will get a right way to understand something under the hood.</p>
<p>Hope next time I do not make the same mistake for others.</p>

            <p>Today is an actual festival for family reunion. But my girlfriend felt depressed. Her father was reviewed by a doctor, and the doctor said that he needs to make a surgery for a tumour on his skin.</p>
<p>Actually, he did the same surgery 2 years ago, but recently he was reviewed that the tumour is relapsed again. The doctor advised him to do the same surgery again.</p>
<p>So that my girlfriend is worried about him. Because the tumour is under his ear. That means if the tumour needs to be cut, his ear has to be peeled first. It will make a severe pain to himself.</p>
<p>Another thing made her anxious is that if the tumour relapsed again and again, who can make sure the disease would be cured indeed? It should have a nice festival today, However,  her family were falling into the nervous for the father’s tumour. I companied with her searched some information about her father’s disease, but we find more, we worry more.</p>
<p>Hope everything would be fine, and hope her father could make the surgery as soon as possible. Learn the condition of her father from doctors is better than search online.</p>
<p>That also reminds me to face the health problem. I need to be more healthier to prevent someday when I am old but with some diseases. I don’t want anyone especially my family or my friends worry about my body.</p>

            <p>It is a special day. My friend Ryan invited me to his home to have dinner. Since the mid-autumn festival is approaching, so he think we should play together to celebrate it.</p>
<p>Ryan is actually an incredible chef, he even wanted to make some moon cakes! But it is regrettable because the flour cannot stick with water and butter. So the moon cakes were failed.</p>
<p>Although we didn’t eat the moon cake, but Ryan still made some other dishes. Those food are pretty delicious, lamb ribs, bamboo shoot and saliva chicken were all eaten up by us. I even thought it is wasting his talent to be a developer, he should have been a chef.</p>
<p>After dinner, we played a board game German Heart Disease. This game needs a high attention to watch if the cards are valid on the board. If they are valid, we need grab to touch the bell as soon as possible, then the winner will get more cards, until all of cards are occupied by the winner.</p>
<p>The game made me nervous, and it is not easy to play. After that I nearly felt tired. I have to say I am not good at this kind of board game, maybe girls more like that.</p>
<p>This is my first mid-autumn festival out of China, but it still made me warm and happy. Thanks for Ryan and Yifei.</p>

            <p>It’s too late to write, I have an important meeting tomorrow, so I have to write less.</p>
<p>Tonight I met a new friend in the game Dark Souls 3. Even though we cannot speak or write anything in this game. We just used our body movements and some limited formatted messages to contact with each other.</p>
<p>We used the difficult way to make each other to know a complex purpose: Invaded one by one to get 30 scarce props. The 30 props finally could make us to get a platinum trophy of the Dark Souls 3.</p>
<p>I should have written the whole story detailedly. I find this friendly guy online is an actually surprise. We finally add each other as friend on WeChat.</p>
<p>The game process is just like the game Journal, It made me felt truly warm.</p>

            <p>Recently I have a little bit depressed about my best friend.</p>
<p>He is the only one I am truly admired when I was in high school. At that time, he was good at anything as long as he was interested. Whether it is study, sport, music or game. He just liked a star which is flashing constantly.</p>
<p>In my mind, I have been expecting someday I could have a company with him, and we could challenge this world for displaying some our personal beliefs.</p>
<p>However, it was ruined by the social reality after we graduated from high school. I got a conflict when I was applying a university, so I dropped down to a mediocre university. I lost passion and belief in there. Because to meet an excellent guy is difficult in there. It just like you cannot make a delicious dish in a cesspit.</p>
<p>I was lost a whole year at the beginning of my university. At the same time, my friend had lost something more important in his life. That is the interest.</p>
<p>He lost interest in any objects in this world. The only one he loved is philosophy, but he was involved into a strange situation is that he cannot find significance from anything. This status made him depressed everyday until now.</p>
<p>He dropped out from his university, and became a totally failure in society.</p>
<p>After I earned more, I pursued him came to Beijing with me, to study to be a programmer. So that finally he could get an interesting job by himself.</p>
<p>But I was totally wrong. I felt disappointed for him. He didn’t have a right attitude to learn. He had an ineffective status on studying programming. He didn’t have any passion on it. Because that is difficult to pursue anyone to breakout their cozy zone.</p>
<p>I argued a few times with him, then I was almost desperate. I am not a lucky guy, I have gone through a series of tragedies. After saw his status I had to think about my future, cause I am not same with him. I don’t have a happy family, I have to away from my hometown to find a place truly fit me.</p>
<p>Although I am not in Beijing, I still feel regret about him. I don’t know how to save him to be a positive guy. I want to pursue him to see a phycologist, but he must be disgusted. After all, he is such a smart guy, he has his pride and no one could ruin it mercilessly.</p>

            <p>I was working overtime the whole last week.</p>
<p>After I released a new version, I heard my colleague said no one force me to work hard, and everything I did overtime is what I asked for.</p>
<p>These words made me extremely angry. Because I didn’t tell anyone how I was tired, I didn’t force anyone work hard or work professionally for the work relating to me. I even didn’t tell anybody I released the new version at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>I don’t need a word ‘Thank you,’ but I cannot accept anyone who said I am so tired because that is what I asked for.</p>
<p>Why I have to do overtime on the project because I want to build something professional, I want to develop a project standard, rather than like the kids toys what they did before in this technical team.</p>
<p>I cannot believe even though I have already tried my best to suffer the shitty techniques in my team. I don’t force anyone who just wants keep the shitty work as before. But there are still some people think I have infringed their interest. Yes, because they just want to take money with the relaxing shitty work as before. I even do not want call them software engineers or web developers. They did the work just like any other work which doesn’t need some knowledges or techniques.</p>
<p>I don’t care about your mediocre attitude on work. My friend persuaded me that if you want to make a delicious dish, you cannot make it on a cesspit. Yes, he is right, the team on technique for me is  totally a cesspit. Maybe I shouldn’t pay any effort on those shitty work and in this complacency team.</p>
<p>Whatever your boats flow, work the shit with you is not my destination.</p>
<p>On the next phase, I should rethink about how could I improve my personal interest on the spare time. I won’t work overtime anymore, and I won’t make any project standard. Because even if I make effort on those work, there still are some one against me.</p>
<p>What a small company! There are only six guys in the team. Why it has so many complex office politics!</p>
<p>If we have two kinds of worldview as a programmer, why you didn’t give any respect on my professional work? Am I infringed any interest on you? Don’t you feel ashamed?</p>
<p>Fuck this team, and fuck this work. I don’t care about how bad you did before, anyway you will prevent me to improve the shit better. That’s fine, I won’t play with you. Someday I will meet some respectful and advanced people, all I need to do is enter the team which is appropriate for me.</p>
<p>So I need to change my strategy to make more interests for myself after work. I cannot lose my original intention, and I must seek the destination using my whole life. At that time, you boring guys will be ignored. That’s why I called it revenge.</p>

            <p>Sorry guys I was lost today. I was playing the game Dark Souls 3 whole day until 4 a.m. That makes me satisfied.</p>
<p>Actually, I just killed the three golden angels on top of the final tower hundreds of times, to gain more souls for preparing the new game plus.</p>
<p>My head is dizzy, and I cannot write anymore. Sleeping! Bye!</p>

            <p>I have nothing to say today. Cause I just released a new version of our project.</p>
<p>I have worked overtime more than 9 hours today. For now, I just want to go bed to sleep.</p>
<p>Another thing is I have asked leave for rest tomorrow. So I can get a good dream.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
