            <p>I met a problem today. Since we have already used the JIRA to control our project from two weeks ago, so that I don’t need to make an extended plan for each month to get an overview of the whole project. Then I find there are some issues with the agile progress.</p>
<p>In JIRA, there are lots of issues, stories, and tasks are recorded in Backlog. We make every two weeks an active Sprint. The Sprint means a period that we need to release a deliverable version at the end of it.</p>
<p>When we don’t have any tasks on To-DO list, we just need to pick up an issue or task from the Backlog. To get which one depends on how critical the issues are. Usually, we move the high-priority tasks from the Backlog.</p>
<p>Everything looks fine, isn’t it? But I don’t think so. I had been trying this way about two weeks then I found something important. One of the key questions is how can I arrange tasks averagely for an extended period. I don’t want to take easy at the beginning, then find we don’t have enough time in the last week to deliver our project before the deadline. If we found then, and we cannot finish the project even if we work overtime, we cannot face our clients.</p>
<p>When we use JIRA to pick tasks from Backlog to our TO-DO list, we just focus on how much time do we have to do a task. Then we only choose a task we think it is proper for our work time. However, you won’t know how many tasks you need to implement and how much rest time do you have. That means you won’t know whether you can deliver the final product in time for your clients.</p>
<p>That’s what I worry. I think we still need a long-term plan for arranging how many tasks do we need to implement in every week. As the long-term plan, we may need to add more tasks to our TO-DO list. It will give us pressure to estimate how much work we should finish at each week. If we delayed something, we might need to work overtime to ensure the last week we can deliver the product. At the mean time, use this way we may be able to reject some low-priority requirements, and we could show the relevant evidence to other colleagues.</p>
<p>Just a little experience from my work. Ideally, we should combine a long-term plan and an agile way to control our development process. Wish anyone who has a better idea could discuss with me without any hesitance.</p>

            <p>Emmmmm. It’s another dull day. I got up nearly 2 a.m. Then I just had breakfast instead of lunch. Then the dreary day started.</p>
<p>I cannot remember how long I chatted with my girlfriend. The only one thing I can make sure is that I didn’t leave my bed until night.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any interest in learning today. So even there is no game worth to play, I still put myself to Bloodborne. That could make me passed the day quickly.</p>
<p>That’s it. It’s nothing worth to record today. Hope I could persuade our designer tomorrow. Blessing me.</p>

            <p>There is good news that tomorrow is a holiday so I could stay at home to sleep a whole day. I never heard the festival before. It seems like a kind of game that horse race.</p>
<p>I don’t have more anticipation on it. Just know tomorrow is a holiday is totally enough to me.</p>
<p>But we leave a whole day means that we only have four workdays this week. That would confuse my work plan, and I don’t know whether we could release a deliverable version on Friday.</p>
<p>So the holiday makes me anxious more instead of feeling happy. The key point to me is how to persuade our professional UI designer to change his design simpler for our project. That will decide how much confidence we could have to make the new version released.</p>
<p>Since in these two days, no one wants to work. So I have to prepare enough significant opinions in advance. Hope we can trade it off to a better solution.</p>

            <p>Apple makes me anxious with their new released MacBook Pro. I cannot easy to choose one for my girlfriend to do artwork. And also, Microsoft released the excellent product Surface Studio, which makes me realized Apple is becoming worse every year.</p>
<p>We have been waiting for the new MacBook Pro more than three years. I don’t know how many guys just like me we are always waiting for the new product to upgrade our old one.</p>
<p>But how can we accept that? A laptop for ‘professional’ users but it doesn’t have an ESCAPE key? How can I code without that key? Especially, I am a VIM user.</p>
<p>Additional, I don’t think the silly touch bar is efficient for our professional users, such as designers, programmers, and music makers. We don’t want to switch our sight between keyboard and screen. And we also don’t need to control our work between the solid keyboard and the virtual keyboard. I suppose the virtual keyboard is only invented for the eldest people or the people who cannot type without looking their keyboard.</p>
<p>And the four USB-C ports are the worst feature on the new version to me. I cannot imagine how many lines I need to buy, and how many lines I need to take with the MacBook outside. If someday I find I don’t have a proper line at home, I have to go outside and to buy a conversion line. Or to choose to buy one online but need to wait a few days. How ineffective it is! Is that truly produced for professional users?</p>
<p>My girlfriend will be a designer, so I just want to pick up a decent machine for her. However, now I am totally confused. I don’t want to pay so much for the terrible MacBook. It is too expensive for its wrong changes.</p>
<p>Surface Studio might be a right choice. But I extremely dislike Windows operation system. It just likes junk to me. You cannot imagine how ugly it is when it renders text on the 5k screen. And also I don’t want to use two different environments in my home. That means for everything I have to control with two accounts and two different configs.</p>
<p>How about iMac? It should have been a good choice. But please note it uses 5k display but has a mediocre graphics. I don’t want to see the bad performance during animation at the next version of MacOS.</p>
<p>We all know VR is becoming more and more popular. Most of the best VR products are only supported by Windows. That means if you want to try any of them, you have to get a Windows computer. So it seems like choosing the Surface Studio would be better. Even though all the choices are totally shit to me. I even want to give them up all.</p>
<p>Does anyone have the same feeling on the shitty choice? Apple makes me disappointing again. I cannot figure out the best solution for making our studio cozy. We want to code, we want to design, and we want to play games without any other complicated upset.</p>

            <p>I found an attractive toy these days. It called Launchpad that produced by Novation.</p>
<p>The Launchpad is a music clips controller, and it also is a perform instrument. It could be stuck with the live music editing software Ableton. We can use the pad to record different clips and adjust the different tracks to make some excellent remix music.</p>
<p>I don’t know much on that because it is a complicated device, there might be more than hundreds combined keys could be used for different functionalities. The only think I know is there are four main modes on the top of Launchpad, and when we want to play it as an instrument, we need to switch it to the mode Note.</p>
<p>I called it a toy because it has a colorful RGB lights on the panel. It has 8x8 blocks on it, and each of them is programmable. So some people did lots of related projects with dazzling light when performing a remix music.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether I will play it frequently if I bought it. But for these days, I was indeed attracted to it. My girlfriend seems doesn’t like it. Even though it doesn’t have a high price, I still need to think about if I will buy it.</p>
<p>You might be shocked by it too: <a href="https://youtu.be/0KX3Us11LrY" target="_blank" rel="external">Launchpad Pro</a></p>

            <p>You know that I was addicted to Dark Souls again. I took a whole night to play the latest DLC Ashes of Ariandel on it.</p>
<p>The DLC imports some new weapons and armors for the critical feature arena. As for the drama on DLC, I have to say it is too short. There are only two bosses in the DLC world, and I only took three hours passed them.</p>
<p>Then I tried the new weapons in the arena with other players, and it is indeed interesting feature for the Dark Souls. We can even fight with at most eight people in the meantime. Also, I played it with my friend Chong Wang a while, but actually I just showed off my new weapons to him.</p>
<p>It is too late now, and I have to make the journal finished immediately because my eyes will close before I can get the bed.</p>

            <p>There are some exciting products are releasing recently. They produced by Microsoft, PlayStation, and Apple. All those products are expensive and attractive to me. I am not sure if I can ignore them and save money for the Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>As we all know, PlayStasion has been releasing their killer product PS VR a few weeks. I have already ordered one in mid-September. And the good news I received today is that a shipment of PS VR just arrived in the EB Games’ warehouse, so that I could get it these days. At the mean time, I have to pay the rest of amount except the deposit I’ve already paid.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Microsoft made a product launch. The shiniest product for me is the Surface Studio. It has a 28-inch pixel sensed touchscreen display, and it even surpasses current 4K displays. There is also a new stuff as a tool on the screen. It called Surface Dial. If you never see it before, trust me you will feel shocked with that. I think it should be the best accessibility for designers. You can use it on the screen to zoom your artwork or pick a color from the color palette which calculated by the particular environment.</p>
<p>If I am a designer, I will take all money to buy it. Fortunately, I am not.</p>
<p>And for the later today, there will be another big cheese that Apple will upgrade their key product MacBook. I have been waiting for it more than three years. These years they didn’t update anything except some foundational hardware, such as CPU or Memories. But it doesn’t impress me, and I have no reason to update my device.</p>
<p>As the latest rumors, they media said that the new MacBook has a line of LED keyboard. It’s awesome, doesn’t it? However, It might be amazing for you rather than me. Because I am a VIM user, but It unexpectedly doesn’t have an ESCAPE key on the new keyboard. How can I use a virtual key to code? Oh, my sky will be full of haze, and we VIM guys don’t know where should we go.</p>
<p>Summing up all the information in one sentence is that take my money and shut up.</p>

            <p>Even the Front-end world changes frequently. It still keeps outdated in Australia.</p>
<p>My friend Ryan asked me to help him analyze the interview questions from Kogan.com. He is applying for a Front-end job from the company.</p>
<p>Since Kogan is open for technical communities, so I have a good impression on it. Once I attended a meetup which organized by Melbourne React Community, and Kogan supported the space, supplied food and drinks for us.</p>
<p>When I got the interview questions from Ryan, I was surprised how easy the questions are. I even feel any front-end engineer in China has a little bit knowledge and experience could get the job.</p>
<p>There are four front-end questions. The first one is just like an 8-kyu-level challenge in Codewars.com. The second is about how to handle AJAX calls sequentially and parallel. That is so easy we even could find more than five different ways to make it progressively. The third question looks a little bit complicated because it related the knowledge prototype chain and object-oriented programming in ECMAScript 5. Does anyone remember what is ECMAScript 5? Even the description of the third question is so long. It is still easy to write. If we use the ‘Function.apply’ we even could have got extra points.</p>
<p>The final question is another joke. It describes a particular business situation on Kogan. The question asks us how to back and make the page which has a list view fixed to the previous position after users entered a specific item. How ironic question it is. Because I can see the issue is still in where we look up goods on Kogan.</p>
<p>The question is still not difficult to answer, and even we have to think about the browser compatibility. We could make the answer divided into two parts. One is to use History API for those browsers which upper than IE10. Another also needs to divide into two parts again. One for SPA architecture, another for traditional website multiple pages. For the SPA, we could save data globally to memory from list view before entered a specific item. If the architecture using multiple pages, we could use LocalStorage or SessionStorage to save the related data and scroll position.</p>
<p>Known even the Kogan make the simplest questions for the interview. I feel relieved:)</p>

            <p>Sorry guys, I was involved in Dark Souls again. But the reason is not for the latest DLC. My friend got the Dark Souls 3 a few weeks ago. So at tonight, I just taught him some essential skills and gave him some useful weapons in the game.</p>
<p>Also, when we were connecting with each other, there were a few players as enemies invaded us. It was a funny process we killed every one who try to escape. I still remembered how hurt I used to when I suffered attacks from other guys. No one could help me then; even the general enemies helped those players to attack me together. Today, I finally could revenge for the players who always want to kill others.</p>
<p>I should have written more for the detailed how we fight with other players, but it is too late now. I have to sleep. Otherwise, I won’t get up to take a shower tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I could play it with him tomorrow so that I won’t make a flag today. The man is escaping now.</p>
