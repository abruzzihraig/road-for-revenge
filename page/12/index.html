            <p>Thanks to my bro Dolphin. By his help, I finally understand the knowledge how does canvas effect on different resolutions. The problem has puzzled me a few years, but I have never been trying to figure it out. Whatever, it’s not too late. But it made me dizzy a while.</p>
<p>Like what I said before, I really feel sick with the graphics code. Even though I just used some basic mathematics I learned from my high school. It doesn’t mean it’s easy to write by coding. The code is more abstract than equation on paper. Also, you can draw some shapes on your draft, but you cannot write a comment that is easy to understand in code. Once you met any issue or bug, you have to stop everything before you understand what you did in the previous code. That really makes me discouraged.</p>
<p>In programming, you may need to be more careful on those edge conditions. Such as a divisor must not be zero, a slope could be infinite. You have to take care of every edge condition on your code to prevent those bugs which are hard to test.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may take much time to maintain your logic, and the situations you write more, the complexity would be harder. Today, when I found my conditions were written in draw function became more and more complicated, I tried to recreate the basic mathematical model of these complicated parts. After two hours, all the things got done with a clear way. That is the hardest part for me–you won’t know what is the best way before you taste bitterness in graphics programming, and, the cost is expensive.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’m not a genius, as well as I’m not good at math. So I can just keep admiring on those guys who really like to do awesome stuff with graphics by coding.</p>

            <p>I am so sleepy and I can’t write too much. I just prepared something toning for the Friday’s leaving. I wrapped my PS VR for borrowing to my boss Yee. He wanted the device from the Christmas. So that he could play it with his family during I rest in China. Also, I downloaded some variety shows to my iPad for the long flight trip.</p>
<p>For the recent work, all the things in my part look well. I may give them a demo before I leave.</p>
<p>It’s a happy waiting time to me. Just keep relaxing and enjoy the next two workdays.</p>

            <p>I worked overtime tonight to support those outdated browsers. I made some fallback ways for keeping the effect page flipping consistent among all popular browsers.</p>
<p>From tomorrow, I will apply shadow textures on the effect to make it more natural. Ideally post a demo online before I leave should be a good work to me. Hope everything that I will handle is well. Because I don’t know how much time I have spent for handling those browser compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for my boss to ignore the support of IE8.</p>

            <p>I was shopping a whole day for preparing gifts to my relatives and friends. Since my trunk has enough space so I have to buy something small. Hence the most ideal gift to me is health product.</p>
<p>I went to a pharmacy to buy a case of Swisses products—which is a famous brand around the world and from Melbourne. I studied how to choose a health product online and knew which product could improve the relative symptom. Then I made a Todo list for those health products that will be purchased.</p>
<p>There are still some gifts for my nephews and my girlfriend haven’t been purchased yet. Maybe I will go shopping more times before I leave.</p>
<p>Need to sleep and to meet next Monday.</p>

            <p>I have to recommend you guys the Korean variety show Infinite Challenge again. Tonight, I watched a special edition that pursuit battle which called One Hundred Bald Head. The episode is 347—the Super 7 guys still were there. It has to be the best pursuit battle that I never saw it before.</p>
<p>If you used to see an anime Lire Game by Shinobu Kaitani(one of my favorite cartoonists), you would know the most amazing part in the game is complicated relations among a group of people. Everyone in the group must try their best to protect their interest to get the final victory. So that you can see there are so many activities in human nature, such as betray or ally some people anytime. Hence the story of this kind of game is full of hints and reversals. The show I watched tonight is just like this type of game.</p>
<p>The One Hundred Bald Head is a game that there are seven cases which are locked within one hundred bald heads, and only 2 cases could have three million cash or negative one. The seven MC Members need to find those cases and search some clues for checking if a case has cash or nothing.</p>
<p>Since the game is performed perfectly by those seven MCs, you will laugh and be shocked every minute by their intelligence. It absolutely would change your impression of variety shows.</p>
<p>Just search and enjoy it when you have nothing to do.</p>

            <p>I don’t know how to help my girlfriend to overcome her poor English. She never listened to me on those essential things which would lead us to a better situation. If she failed on the IELTS test again, she might not be able to come to me.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I persuaded her one year before that she should become to prepare her English for the IELTS test. She always gives me an annoying reason for those insignificant things. I told her do not escape from the hard but essential things. However, she never cared about them until she got failed recently.</p>
<p>These days she stayed at home but didn’t see or listen to anything about English. Just slept more than twelve hours every day but did nothing. And she told me that she has lots of important things need to do every afternoon except her English.</p>
<p>How can I save you, my girlfriend? You always drop out your opportunity to make yourself in crisis. You know you are not a smart girl but why don’t you make an effort for those important things and be responsible for your future life? I am so disappointed when you hung up my call as I criticized you. If you really care about that, why you cannot pass those things? Are they really cannot be touched by your efforts?</p>
<p>I don’t want to lose hope on you again and again and all over again. This is not a difficult thing that to choose and to solve the most critical thing on the way to future. I won’t back to China due to your stupid choice. You can escape from every hard work, but please at least just let me admire you once. I don’t want to live like a loser all the time. I don’t want to see my friend or my girlfriend to be always a loser too. Why cannot just overcome such a simple challenge for the future? I am not your parents who could protect you all the time. If you failed on something, you could return to your family, but I cannot. That’s the most primary difference between we both. If you don’t like that and think the pressure from me is too heavy for you, Just tell me you cannot do that—a English test each student could pass by their efforts.</p>
<p>I could have more than one thousand reasons to come back to China except the one called Poor English. So disappointed I am.</p>
