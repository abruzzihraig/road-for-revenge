            <p>There are only 18 days before I come to China. So I started to update my VPN service on both of servers and clients.</p>
<p>I have to say Surge is the best software for the purpose of network proxy. You can proxy any network requirement on your devices. The new version Mac Surge 2 has a dashboard, which could make monitoring the network on your device easier. And also, the author is absolutely generous. If you have bought an iOS Surge before, you could claim a license for the new Mac Surge 2. Trust me, it is beyond its price.</p>
<p>I have had two VPSs run ShadowSocks all the time. But there is only one defect that I don’t have a Chinese server. So I cannot access overseas any video or music which has a Chinese copyright limitation. Wish someone could share the Chinese VPS with me.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is still the holiday of the New Year’s Day. So let me have a relaxing sleep.</p>

            <p>This is the last day of 2016. Everyone in my friend circle posted their summaries of the year. But I didn’t and I won’t do it. That’s because the fallen time doesn’t worth to sum. Actually, I have more than ten thousands words to be written, especially which I learned and felt a heap of matters during this year overseas.</p>
<p>Just bury my words with my fallen spirit.</p>

            <p>I made a masterpiece tonight.</p>
<p>It was almost 9 p.m. I found that my network speed was too slow to open any website. So I accessed to the admin system of my router. Then I found something shocking to me—there were two devices named Hon Hai appeared on the table which displayed all accessed clients.</p>
<p>That must be a Chinese guy, I guessed.</p>
<p>So immediately I banned him by the addresses of his devices. But it doesn’t have any punishment on him, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>I was not satisfied with the kind result. So I decided to make an ARP attack on his devices. Yes, just to be a middle man and to hijack his sessions with the server he is going to access.</p>
<p>For that purpose, I downloaded and compiled a bunch of programs in my MacBook Pro. At the mean time, my friend Dolphin called me to play the game Uncharted 4. After some attempts, I met a critical issue with the outdated library Driftnet, which is used for hijacking images from a network.</p>
<p>So I had to stop the work and went to play with my friends. Before I started the game, I changed the SSID name of my network to “SB_Hon_Hai.” I assumed this guy would try to invade my network continuously. So the name “SB_Hon_Hai” would be a great gift for him.</p>
<p>For the sake of safety, before started the game, I locked my door.</p>
<p>Everything looked fine until we finished the game and I was going to close the TV. I found my TV cannot access to my network no matter what I tried. It seemed like something blocked it…wait, thought I realized something—is it one of Hon Hai?</p>
<p>I googled the name Hon Hai immediately, and I found Hon Hai belongs to Foxconn—one of the largest electronics industry companies. I turned my sight to my Sony TV and Sony PS4. I thought I got the whole world at that moment.</p>
<p>God bless my wisdom.</p>

            <p>This is the last day of the long public holiday. I played the game Uncharted 4 with my friend tonight. The survival mode of Uncharted 4 is extremely fantastic. We were too tense to hold controller effectively. But I have to say we were involved in the amazing online game.</p>
<p>It is too late now, I have to take a shower and go bed to sleep. Hope tomorrow we will get a cozy room in the office.</p>

            <p>I was invited to my friend Ryan’s home tonight. I took a board game Catan to his home to play after dinner.</p>
<p>Catan is the board game which I am really familiar. I can still remember its rules even though I haven’t played it more than one year. It’s also the first genuine board game I bought. I can pay less than 20% of the genuine board game in China, why not choose piracy? Since I have already in Australia, Surly I should buy a genuine one.</p>
<p>The genuine Catan has an elegant box with a few grooves which have different shapes could be filled with those cards and props. When you put the cards together on your table, you will get a smooth and flat map. But in piracy, you will be bothered with the rugged map.</p>
<p>I used to call myself Catan Yang because I always win the most rounds of Catan I played in the past. I don’t know why but the result indeed indicates that I have high winning percentage on this game, I guess that might be 80 percent or higher. Just like there is a God of Catan always protects me when I develop my territory.</p>
<p>Just like what I said that I have high winning percentage on this game. We played two rounds tonight, and each round might take 90 minutes. Even though I suffered many obstructions, finally I won all of them. And the result protected the title again.</p>
<p>I have to say play board games are the best way to make friends closer. I will buy another famous strategy board game “Puerto Rico” when it is in store.</p>
