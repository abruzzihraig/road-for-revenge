            <p>I did dozens of requirements for improving some user experiences on our website KDP. Since tomorrow is the final day for our front-end guys to handle code and ready to deploy. So there were lots of colleagues became product managers to criticize our work and put their unthoughtful opinions anytime. I am angry with that behavior by others. If you really care about our work, please put your opinions or ideas before nearing the day when we need to release the final project.</p>
<p>Felt tired in this small infighting company.</p>

It is an incredible Live MIDI controller. It is not easy to learn, but it really hits me. I found some funny projects online could be performed on my Launchpad. Like all of the instruments, to perform a project better, you have to practice more. That’s why I played it so late.</p>
<p>I have to go bed to sleep, to welcome the shitty requirements at tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I heard a tedious argument many times these two years. That is ‘To be an entertaining person.’ You can easily find the sentence in SNS, some people use it as theirs intro/motto.</p>
<p>The words sound like a shameful flag. You could find some words similar in non-mainstream period ten years before. Such as ‘Forgot love’ or ‘Promised to be the angle for each other.’ Does anyone hold the flag to be an interesting person cannot feel a little shame? I guess so. They’ll find themselves stupid someday. And they will wipe the memory as some people want to wipe their childish tattoos.</p>
<p>I call them poser for the behavior titled themselves to be a different one than others. I don’t know why they can get the sense of superiority from discriminating others. But I will accept the tedious behavior as they have their right to build their life.</p>
<p>I don’t want to push myself to be any person or to make myself get a sense of belonging in a social circle. Life is short, and I don’t want to against my heart to be a phony. I know I have few friends could chat deeply on the topic that life. That’s why I really feel depressed every day. I pretend to be a happy guy for everyone, and it makes me tired after I get home.</p>
<p>I searched a man who named Yu Jae Seok today. He is a well-known MC in Korea. I know him because I watched Running Man many times in the past, which is hosted by him. And he always appears kind and comfortable. So I tried to learn more about him.</p>
<p>I nearly took one hour to know what a kind of person he is. Then I found hundreds of comments by lots of actors and singers who are active in the Korean entertainment circle. Everyone respects him in Korea. He is the only one who is thought by people that he could get 99% votes if he participates in the presidential election. Even he has already got a huge success, but he still feels distressful when he wants to buy a new car instead of the old car he used many years. He doesn’t care about salary and also doesn’t show up anytime. He cares about everyone nearby him and helps them get rid of predicaments. If you watched his program, you would believe he is indeed a unique person who could be loved by everyone. You cannot easy to find someone like him in your whole life.</p>
<p>He is my idol. There is an idiom ‘高山仰止’ in Chinese to describe such person, which means showing great respect for a worthy man. Known what he did makes me feel shameful. I just like a normal person who is used to frame others in work and life. Too small I am comparing with him. I will learn more from this kind of person to be a better man. That is an attractive destination for me rather than just to be entertaining.</p>
<p>No matter what, most of the time I just want to live along and to die as soon as possible. I hate everything occurs in my life. Thought I would keep depressed during my entire life. Let me go is the best blessing to me.</p>

<p>Also, I finally got the discount of the Novation Launchpad Pro. I wrote it before in my diary. It is an attractive toy to me, and I feel so happy to got 30% discount on it.</p>
<p>Forget the meaningful stuff I should have worked. Let me die within the enjoyable life. I will bear more critiques as I just write the inability of myself on the dozens of journals.</p>
<p>But Uncle is still keeping his smile and waving his hand for me. I’ve become a devout believer.</p>

            <p>Every day, I feel full of passion to work, and I always set a promise for myself during walking to the office. I said to myself at tonight I should write some code for my fancy stuff. And I even think about the structure of my personal project every morning. But once I got home, I wouldn’t  want to do anything about coding. I don’t know why I am so resisted to work on my personal stuff. I mean programming is always attractive to me, I feel enjoyable when coding. However, I just do not want to write code in the evening. I know that is harmful to my life, but I still cannot get rid of it.</p>
<p>More than three months I have not written my image editor. And I feel it worse as time flies, the feeling is terrible to me. There is nothing significant on my Github, and I even do not want to tell anyone my account, because I feel shameful, there is nothing worth to show. I have pursuit and taste, and I really want to make craft high-quality and elegant. But I always let myself down.</p>
<p>No one can save myself until I break it up. Hope someday I could continue to work on my image editor, there will be a bunch of stuff need to refactor. I don’t care about if anyone will use it. But that is an artwork to myself, and it is a promise as well. Get away from the white shadows.</p>

            <p>‘Safari is another Internet Explorer’ is not a joke. I paid a whole day for a weird issue on iOS Safari. And now I still don’t have any clue on it. I almost get insane.</p>
<p>The issue mainly occurs on my Boss’s iPhone 6 Plus. When use his iPhone 6 Plus to access my website, and fetched an artwork list then try to open one of them with the image editor, the website will break and reload suddenly. It initially didn’t show on my iPhone 6S. I guessed that’s because my iPhone 6S has a more powerful hardware than iPhone 6 Plus, and maybe the iPhone 6 Plus breaks due to lack of RAM.</p>
<p>However, I borrowed iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C from other colleagues to try to test the issue, and they both didn’t get crashed unexpectedly. The result totally confused me: Why the iPhone 6 Plus will break more frequently but iPhone 5 won’t?</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, iPhone 6 Plus will break almost every time. But that doesn’t mean the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 6s won’t crash. They just occur the issue with a lower frequency.</p>
<p>The most complicated problem is that the issue occurs randomly. When I fetch more than 100 artworks data(each item only includes some necessary data), all devices will have a high frequency to crash. The iPhone 6S is relatively safe.</p>
<p>When I try to fetch 20 artworks data, the device iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPhone 6S won’t break except for the iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>When I try to get only five artworks, all of them will be fine. Of course, it is a relative ‘fine.’ There is no way to prevent the crashing entirely.</p>
<p>Don’t think the weird issue just occurs in the process when fetching artwork data. When we try to fetch 20 artworks and every device looks fine, then pick up one of them and open it with the Image Editor, you will see the iPhone 6 Plus will totally break. As for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C will have a medium frequency to crash. Only iPhone 6S will live longer.</p>
<p>In Chinese, we call the issue bug of mystery. I know when open image editor, it will load a JSON object with a base64 dataUrl, it will occupy more memory in a browser. Most of the time the iPhone 6 Plus crashes on this step. After edited the final artwork and ready to save and close the image editor, the image editor will export dataUrl from the canvas. And that would be another memory-waste operation. It will make some iPhones crashed as well.</p>
<p>It sounds like the memory runs out, right? But after my friend Dolphin helped me to reduce the memory usage with Blob object and window.URL instead of base64 dataUrl. The crash issue still occurs randomly. I even want to buy my boss another new iPhone. Why does the fucking Safari on iPhone 6 Plus have such thorny problem? Why doesn’t Apple care about its shit? I nearly took seventy percent of the time to find and to fix the issues on Safari in this project.</p>
<p>Am I wrong to make the content rich? Why you Apple with your shitty Safari always obstructs we front-end guys to build a website better? Why you always have so many issues on your platform and turn a blind eye on it?</p>
<p>I will witness you collapse at someday.</p>
