            <p>I don’t know why my waist is so pain tonight, I even cannot sit on chair. It might be caused by I practicing guitar with a wrong posture.</p>
<p>I found a funny British guy on Youtube when I was learning English spoken. The guy masters Chinese and posted a stack of videos online. From those funny videos I understand why Chinese is the language that most difficult to learn. And also the guy describes why the discrimination exists when different nations cannot understand each other by different languages. It really opens my eyes.</p>

But I really feel tired about the conflicts between us. She never accepts my viewpoint, I never accept hers either. Maybe the best solution is we both leave.</p>

            <p>I worked overtime tonight. For complaining, I sent a long email to my boss so that I don’t want to practice writing more today. The email will be displayed by the following portion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When can we rewrite the whole ks injection and the project venue portal? You don’t actually know how bad these projects are. Every day we spent a few hours to find where a stupid bug comes from, then tried to fix it just by one or two line code. But found the stupid reason may take us 3 hours.<br>&nbsp;<br>If we fixed a bug, the fixed code might cause other side effects, then someday the new issues come again on JIRA. I don’t want to waste our precious dev resources and time on such silly and unmaintainable projects more. I can promise even though we modify these existing code two years; the project won’t be good as KDP. You shouldn’t use me on such work that everyone can do it. And I actually cannot rescue the legacy code, the authors of Ks injection and venue portal are not real engineers.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, I might pay at least one week to fix some silly issues on video insertion, and every time I fix one, the another issue comes. But I tried to rewrite the video insertion yesterday. You may not believe I just used 4 hours but implemented the same basic functionalities and effects as before. I’m totally confused why they could write code more than 2000 lines to implement such simple feature. They did those projects with the lowest related knowledge. You even can feel every part in those projects are full of the flavor from some developer question websites.<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe our backend projects are bad too. Everything about deploying and testing and debugging in our team is totally amateur. You cannot believe how stupid we are when debugging an issue in production online, just like debugging CPU. Do you believe I can finish both of front-end and backend of KS injection only 3 months? Do you really think the injection is difficult like what you guys thought? If I got any my best backend friend in China, I think we two guys can finish all work from Kakku set up only one year, and with high quality and maintainability.<br>&nbsp;<br>So don’t be blind, there is no one can be called architect in this company. I don’t think some people here can pass the basic tech interview. If you really care about the company, you should think about why we always produce the low-quality products with a bunch of issues/bugs, and also why we paid so much time on those shitty work.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don’t want to see the same situation this year–we waste time on those bugs of the poor projects again and again.Then when close to the end of the year, there will be a voice urge us that we don’t have time to make projects better or we don’t have time to rewrite or we don’t have time for anything except someone’s bad decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you still don’t care about the current low-efficiency status on everybody, and if you still think the dev team works normally as you expect. Trust me, someday the good guys will leave, and the bad guys will eat the company up.</p>

<p>Have a good night! Our leader will bring the new tasks tomorrow from his brilliant brain.</p>

            <p>Tonight is too hot. I cannot focus on anything I wanted to do. The only one thing I did meaningful tonight is that only use less than 20-line code instead of the 2000-line legacy code implemented a live demo for our primary product. I don’t know why these guys wrote so much useless code to implement such a small requirement, plus the 3rd-party libraries, and their legacy code is more than six thousand lines. I believe they had already taken at least three months on it, but why our boss thought that makes sense? It’s funny story, about how to fish in troubled water.</p>

            <p>It’s a relaxing holiday Labour’s day. I implemented a part of my daily plan. But one thing I noticed made me feeling good, which is my girlfriend was learning something about how to love from books.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I have some faults on how I express love to my partner. However, I never tried to figure out those problems. Even though sometimes I think I am using a rational way to analyze any issues between us, I did not really care about how did she think. I predicate that she could learn how to solve those problems between us. That’s the only way to reduce arguments and keep harmony.</p>
<p>Love needs to be learned. If someday I have free time, I wish I could learn the same knowledge from that too.</p>
