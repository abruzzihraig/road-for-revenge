            <p>I tried to implement an effect that flipping web page from a page corner. It is a requirement by our Ad injection service, and it is designed for switching between the original website and the Ad content more humanized.</p>
<p>In general, it is similar to the effect page flipping when we use some fantastic reading apps such as iBooks. It simulates an exact physical situation when we try to flip a page in a book. I studied the page effect from a blog which written by an experienced graphic developer. He taught us that how to deconstruct the physical effect to a mathematic model, and how to avoid some traps in Canvas on modern browsers.</p>
<p>I don’t have enough experience on Canvas before so that I don’t have the confidence to make everything done on the page flipping effect. I tried to analyze the interaction model to comprehensible conditions to ensure the current technologies could implement the effect on browsers.</p>
<p>I also made some sketches to expound how many difficulties need to be overcome. That is not a simple work for me. I am afraid that my colleagues would complain about it.</p>
<p>No matter how tricky the feature is, at least the first step has been taken.</p>

            <p>It’s just a normal gaming day again. Since I bought a bunch of games from the discount activity yesterday, so I tried them one by one until night. But there is a game which makes me disappointed—the Darksider 2. I can’t believe the game only has 30 fps on PS4. So poor performance when the frames motion.</p>
<p>It’s time to sleep, and I need to go outside to buy some gifts for my Chinese friends and families tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I bought the Dark Souls 2 in PS store before the discount activity ends. I used to think the Dark Souls 2 is a failing work as one of the Dark Souls series. Unlike the first or the third generation of Dark Souls series, the second generation directed by another video game director. So that there are lots of comments said the Dark Souls 2 lacks of the original spirit of Dark Souls. And that’s why I didn’t buy it before until got the discount recently.</p>
<p>However, after I tried it a few hours, I found the Dark Souls 2 is better than what I expected. The instruction set is completely same as the Dark Souls 3. So I could easy and fast to pick the instructions up. As for the perspective on the game, it is better than Dark Souls 1 but duller than the third. It’s enough for my taste. Supposed that I could find more funny stuff in the game.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the last day that I don’t need to work with my unfriendly colleagues. So I decide to invite my Chinese guys to have a Korean fried chicken as a celebration.</p>

            <p>I watched the Korean variety show Infinite Challenge tonight. The special edition which I watched is called The Eraser That Wipes Bad Memory. Each MC in the variety show as a psychological counselor to help strange people who have bad memory during their life.</p>
<p>Each MC seated in a temporary tent which located on the busiest street in those prosperous cities. There were few people tried to enter the tent. So they waited for strangers much time until night came. Once a stranger entered in a tent, he/she would be surprised by those famous MCs. Those MCs used their particular ways to help the strangers to speak their regrettable stories, and gave them comfort. There were lots of tears within those stories. It truly touched me.</p>
<p>After the strangers had spoken their regrettable stories, they were recommended to write those bad memory that they regretted. Then they used a special eraser to wipe the words out. The pressure from the memory blew as well.</p>
<p>So I asked myself: What is the worst memory I want to wipe out?</p>
<p>There is always a clear answer for the question. That is the most regrettable story in my life—I used to steal cash from my grandma when I was a child. I don’t know how many times I watered my tears for the bad memory even today. I don’t know if anyone who went through the event could forgive me from their heart. I cannot hold back to regret the silly action from my freaky childhood. I’m not the evil. I don’t want to be the man hurts the only one who loves him in the world. I’m so sorry for you, my grandma.</p>

            <p>There are only 18 days before I come to China. So I started to update my VPN service on both of servers and clients.</p>
<p>I have to say Surge is the best software for the purpose of network proxy. You can proxy any network requirement on your devices. The new version Mac Surge 2 has a dashboard, which could make monitoring the network on your device easier. And also, the author is absolutely generous. If you have bought an iOS Surge before, you could claim a license for the new Mac Surge 2. Trust me, it is beyond its price.</p>
<p>I have had two VPSs run ShadowSocks all the time. But there is only one defect that I don’t have a Chinese server. So I cannot access overseas any video or music which has a Chinese copyright limitation. Wish someone could share the Chinese VPS with me.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is still the holiday of the New Year’s Day. So let me have a relaxing sleep.</p>

            <p>This is the last day of 2016. Everyone in my friend circle posted their summaries of the year. But I didn’t and I won’t do it. That’s because the fallen time doesn’t worth to sum. Actually, I have more than ten thousands words to be written, especially which I learned and felt a heap of matters during this year overseas.</p>
<p>Just bury my words with my fallen spirit.</p>

            <p>I made a masterpiece tonight.</p>
<p>It was almost 9 p.m. I found that my network speed was too slow to open any website. So I accessed to the admin system of my router. Then I found something shocking to me—there were two devices named Hon Hai appeared on the table which displayed all accessed clients.</p>
<p>That must be a Chinese guy, I guessed.</p>
<p>So immediately I banned him by the addresses of his devices. But it doesn’t have any punishment on him, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>I was not satisfied with the kind result. So I decided to make an ARP attack on his devices. Yes, just to be a middle man and to hijack his sessions with the server he is going to access.</p>
<p>For that purpose, I downloaded and compiled a bunch of programs in my MacBook Pro. At the mean time, my friend Dolphin called me to play the game Uncharted 4. After some attempts, I met a critical issue with the outdated library Driftnet, which is used for hijacking images from a network.</p>
<p>So I had to stop the work and went to play with my friends. Before I started the game, I changed the SSID name of my network to “SB_Hon_Hai.” I assumed this guy would try to invade my network continuously. So the name “SB_Hon_Hai” would be a great gift for him.</p>
<p>For the sake of safety, before started the game, I locked my door.</p>
<p>Everything looked fine until we finished the game and I was going to close the TV. I found my TV cannot access to my network no matter what I tried. It seemed like something blocked it…wait, thought I realized something—is it one of Hon Hai?</p>
<p>I googled the name Hon Hai immediately, and I found Hon Hai belongs to Foxconn—one of the largest electronics industry companies. I turned my sight to my Sony TV and Sony PS4. I thought I got the whole world at that moment.</p>
<p>God bless my wisdom.</p>
