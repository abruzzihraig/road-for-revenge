            <p>My belly was destroyed by my cooked food again. Why I always make food with so much chili sauce? My stomach is screaming now.</p>
<p>I was laying in bed a whole day and watching dramas. This month is a drama month. Most American dramas I favor are released from this month. I just watched the latest seasons of Silicon Valley, Better Call Saul, and Prison Break. The next attempt for me is Fargo. I found it has a high score in Douban. Hope it could satisfy me.</p>

            <p>I finally finished reading the document of MobX. To figure out the part ‘createTransform’ took me much time. I don’t like the way the author writes. Sometimes it uses vague and abstract words to summarize an important concept. There must be clearer examples or sentences to elaborate those concepts we might never meet before.</p>
<p>You can even found some sentences like ‘This can be used to transform an observable data graph into an another observable data graph, which can be used to transform… you get the idea.’ Oh, what kind of idea can I get? I am not a genius, and I am just a learner as a newbie of MobX. The document sucks me all the time, but I have to say it is an excellent solution for state management.</p>
<p>I may need to do some practices for getting what some concepts do actually mean.</p>

            <p>It’s late again. After calculating what I wasted both of money and time on the mobile game SanGuoZhiCaoCaoZhuan online(let’s call it simply SGZ), I suppose it is time to face the truth that I have to say goodbye for the best memory I got from the game.</p>
<p>Playing the SLG game always makes me excited, and SGZ is the best SLG game in my heart from my childhood. I’ve paid it more than 4300 RMB, and every day I spend much of time from I got home till I sleep. It has been invading my regular life. I don’t want to get involved into it deeper, as I know from the current stage, I may need to spend more money on it but can only get a little playfulness from it.</p>
<p>If every day I need to pay 5 hours or more at the game, and every week I can’t help to recharge it more than $50, for only one month I will lose at least 150 hours and $250. Even if I may not use the time and money to do something positive, why shouldn’t I buy a Switch to play Zelda? I can taste more movies, dramas and fantastic games(I mean the game which contains full playfulness just like a kind of arts). I can learn a lot from those entertainments instead of repeating to level each role up in the game SGZ. There are more than 400 characters in SGZ, and most behaviours from those characters are similar.</p>
<p>I don’t refuse to pay for those mobile games if they satisfy me. You pay it earlier then you enjoy it sooner. I don’t like to be strict to use time exchange money. If I do so, I will lose interests soon. That’s why I paid it immediately when I started to play Clash Royale or SGZ. It’s just because they are worth to pay.</p>
<p>But there must be a limitation to prevent from getting involved by their mechanism of making money. Otherwise, I would become a sort of Gods of SanHe.</p>

            <p>It’s nearly 3 a.m. I have to go bed. There’s nothing needs to record today. I read the document of MobX a bit, and I found it is intuitive indeed. I’ll dive into it more this week to decide if MobX is the most appropriate state management framework for my next project. Another good news for me is our team won’t support the browser version below IE 11 anymore. I finally don’t need to care about the shitty object XDomainRequest in outdated IEs(If you don’t use an asynchronous callback from setTimeout to wrap the XDomainRequest, it may be lost sometime).</p>

            <p>My best friend sent me a message on the last night. The message was sent by 6:30 a.m., but it was recalled after awhile. He might think that I had already slept by then, but actually I didn’t. I just got a glimpse of the message as I was too sleepy then so I didn’t want to reply it immediately.</p>
<p>The message is about 20 lines. It basically tells how my friend treats death and life. I don’t remember the details in the message but it is totally negative. He said he finally found why people look forward to death and he wants to escape from life.</p>
<p>The message by the late at night made me sorrowed a whole day. I told our common friends what the situation I met, and we finally decided to have a big chat with the guy in the tomorrow evening. I don’t know how to rescue my friend. He makes me feeling powerless. Hope everything will be fine in the chatting of the tomorrow.</p>
