            <p>There is a bad news that the PS VR I’ve already preordered has been delayed to deliver, and the estimated date of shipment is due in Dec 2016. Please be happy with my sorrow.</p>
<p>Since Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in literature yesterday, I am curious about how excellent writing does he have. I cannot actually understand the poems from his lyrics and his duck-like voice. Even though I heard his songs from junior high school, and I also know lots of his stories. So I decided to find a biography of himself.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called Bob Dylan Chronicles, it describes his legendary life during the luminous period when he made folk music revive in America. He was indeed a talent in that era. I suppose I could feel a few elegant sentences in his writing, it is easygoing rather than obscure.</p>
<p>When he described an environment, he wrote a paragraph like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out side the wind was blowing, straggling cloud wisps, snow whirling in the red lanterned streets, city types scuffling around, bundled up — salesmen in rabbit fur earmuffs hawking gimmicks, chestnut vendors, steam rising out of manholes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a picture of the sense around you when you read the paragraph, isn’t it? It just like yo u lived with him in the story.</p>
<p>However, when he wrote about himself, it comes with below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I was playing at the time were hard-lipped folk songs with fire and brimstone servings, and you didn’t need to take polls to know that they didn’t match up with anything on the radio, didn’t lend themselves to commercialism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could find a little ridicule on his words, the sentences are concise with a little sharp.</p>
<p>Since my reading speed is still slow, so I just read a few pages on the sample of the book. I wish I could read more if I have time. Because he is a hero and a true star to me, I am interested to learn more from his writing to know what did he think in his legendary past.</p>

            <p>Since daylight saving has become, the sunset is getting more late everyday. After one hour overtime, there was still light outside. So I decided to buy some food from market.</p>
<p>There was a little wind with warm sunshine. I walked relaxedly and a few songs of Coldplay were around my head. I can’t help to take a breath then, everything on the road was fresh to me.</p>
<p>I became to think what is my final destination. Beijing? Melbourne? Sydney or a city in US? I don’t know if every step is safe to my future. But I indeed enjoyed the moment I can feel everything comfortable within the beautiful city.</p>
<p>That might be a dreaming island parts of you want to be in, isn’t it? So I should be satisfied even though there are some shitty work are waiting for me all the time. I am a fortunate guy, I have such an opportunity to break out GFW to live in a free and clean island. It should have been a pleasant experience. I need to stop complaining more and to enjoy the truly free time.</p>

            <p>Let me pray for my boss first. He is such a generous guy! He approved me to exchange my overtime to a few days off. I’ve worked more than 43 hours overtime this month. That means I could get more than one month vocation with the rest of my annual leave. The Chinese New Year is waving its hands for me.</p>
<p>I don’t know why it is hard for me to speak English smoothly just like Chinese. There are always something break me in, even though I know how to speak and how to organise a sentence to make sense. But once I open my month, my tough will be frozen suddenly. I cannot speak even a simple word sometimes. That’s actually make me depressed.</p>
<p>I know I have a little bit stammer. But when I use Chinese, I could choose another synonyms quickly if I feel my tough is blocked by a word. So there were little people know I have a slight stammer. But when the situation is changed to English environment. I am totally failed. I guess I could be known as a stupid in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>But how can I get rid of the nightmare? It is hard for me and it is extremely unstable. Sometimes I could speak anything smoothly from my mind. But sometimes I could feel there is an old witch is using a toilet plunger stab into my mouth. I really want to explain to the guys who I was talking to. The frozen time during a talk is always make me embarrassed.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a good idea? I really hope there are some useful recommendations and experience for me.</p>

            <p>My girlfriend showed me a short video about a girl had a cancer. I don’t know where does she get it, but she said it is touching and it nearly made her cry. So she asked me that I have to watch it immediately.</p>
<p>The video only has 10 minutes. It is a TV show about performing a perfect speech. But it’s not like the TED.</p>
<p>The speaker is a women as one of successful people. She got a cancer on her ovary this year. She is still single, that means she will lose a possibility to be a mother if she need to cut her ovary. Even though she might fortunately keep her life after a series of surgeries.</p>
<p>She reviewed and reflected her past during these years. She was too busy to sleep early everyday(That’s why my girlfriend asked me to watch it). She could have done more examinations when her doctor told her there were something abnormal in her body. But she ignored the warning then worked harder than before.</p>
<p>After she passed out at home. A doctor said her tumor in her ovary is too large now. No one knew if it is a vicious tumor. So she had to wait for a surgery to judge.</p>
<p>She nearly broke down. Cause all of efforts for she wanted to seek a better life will be totally ruined by the simple word cancer. She got the cancer even though she exercises regularly all the time.</p>
<p>Her friends and her family around her are sad everyday. They all felt that is unfair and cruel to her. But they also knew it is to late. She was so regretful to work hard before, the hard work made her stay up late every day.</p>
<p>Finally, she wanted every one who was listening to her to remember nothing is important but health.</p>
<p>The story is ended, but my life is continued. Then the next limitation from my girlfriend to me is that I cannot sleep late anymore. Guys, please share my tears.</p>

            <p>I should have recorded something about new technologies or experiences on learning English.  Before I live here, I even thought I will have enough time to learn Haskell or to build an open-source project. But how ashamed I am, I can’t help to tell you guys the game Bloodbourne is holly incredible! I have never seen a better one before. Of course, excepting the Dark Souls 3.</p>
<p>Bloodbourne is just like the game Dark Souls 3. They all designed by the genius guy Hidetaka Miyazaki. The game has a similar art style with Dark Souls series. They are black, repressed, gothic and have an aesthetic violence. There is little word you can get from NPCs during the whole game, but you could reason each clue from the descriptions of props you got from the game. It’s obscure but it has more different understandings among all of the gamers.</p>
<p>It is an extremely difficult game as well, just like Dark Souls. But I cannot say which one is more difficult, cause they have different points on the difficulty. For example, in the Dark Souls 3, you could hold a shield to prevent damage on yourself, but there is no shield in Bloodbourne. However, you have more solutions and a faster speed of injection to revive your life in Bloodbourne. So you cannot simply judge which one is more difficult. But if you are a newbie, no matter which one you want to play, I suppose you will die a thousand of times before you become an expert.</p>
<p>Even though I know I am so decadent during the several months, but I have to say the game Bloodbourne is an extremely attractive game you shouldn’t miss that.</p>

            <p>There was an idea broke out when I was taking shower tonight. That is maybe classifying everyone is essential in the society.</p>
<p>We used to hear that some people said do not classify anyone, because everyone is unique. I thought so before. Yes, everyone is unique for themselves, because no one wants itself normal like any other people. But, to the society, it does’t care about if anyone is unique. That’s a one of rules of the true world.</p>
<p>When I played my guitar and I wanted to find a way to perform music, there were so many music lovers looked same. They have similar taste on every bad thing. I cannot accept that to make myself just like them without human thinking. Most of features on the class were opposite to my belief.</p>
<p>After I became a programmer, I found my friends have same interests and habits. To catch them sometimes are made me tired and boring . For example, they like Japanese anime, they like playing individual games. If any one of them find a new interest thing, the rest of them almost are interested with that. I don’t know why they are always same and happy with that. To me, it feels like I am not in their class.</p>
<p>That made me remind an interesting thing. In the game Dark Souls 3, you can choose a kind of profession as a initialisation. There are multiple types could be chosen, a fighter, an enchanter, an assassin, or something else. There is only one profession specific is called useless man, he has average properties when initialise. Actually during the whole game, if you want to avoid being killed by enemies, you have to contribute yourself as a specific way to be an expert. If you grow averagely, or just grow with your interests, you cannot easy to live in the game world.</p>
<p>It just likes the true society. If you don’t contribute yourself as a specific type, you will be normal and hard to live with the true enemies within the same world.</p>

            <p>Sorry again, it is too late to write for me. I am so sleepy now.</p>
<p>I watched an old movie The Call Of Cthulhu tonight. It was made at 2005, but it was directed with old techniques as 1900. So the movie is black-white and silent.</p>
<p>I watched the movie just want to know the background of the game Bloodbourne. Each game from Hidetaka Miyazaki is extremely obscure, so we have to know more from the background, to know how Hidetaka Miyazaki thinks.</p>
<p>The movie actually looks a little bit boring. It just describes an archaeologist found some clues to confirm the cult was living, the god was existing, and anyone who knew that would be died. I think it might be the first time using recursive memories from different people on fiction. So maybe that’s why it is a classic to Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>
<p>No matter what, Bloodbourne is another excellent game just like Darksouls. Let me live with my sorrow.</p>

            <p>At first, I have to celebrate that finally I got the platinum trophy at tonight. During nearly 300 hours the gaming time, I was really enjoyable. DarkSouls taught me lots of things. The most impressing point to me is that it taught me how to figure out a way to defeat any invincible enemy.</p>
<p>I will never forget the happy and the nervous memories. Treating any enemy equally is a philosophy of the series of DarkSouls, it also warns us we have to be serious to any challenge in our future life.</p>
<p>Another thing is I made a flag today. And it obviously is a bad result to me.</p>
<p>My boss was discussing with our clients these days in Tokyo. He showed our project KDP to them to sell. In the morning, he sent an email to us, and he said he felt we haven’t minified our front-end code in the demo server.</p>
<p>Then I replied confidently that we have already minified code since the first released version. I vowed it with multiple web optimised features that we’ve already done. I even said I thought our project has an industry standard on web performance. I showed him two more optimising ways like CDN or make 3rd-party libraries chunked, and I told him I think the current performance is enough for this phase or just the demo. No one need to worry about it.</p>
<p>After I showed my knowledges off, I tried to rethink why he thought the code hadn’t been minified. I saw the final file after handled by UglifyJS and some other optimised plugins, it was nearly could not be read. However, I noticed there were so many variables hadn’t been mingled. It is so weird.</p>
<p>I took much time on it to find why the variables cannot be mingled by UglifyJS. Finally I knew from the document of UglifyJS that it cannot mingle code from ‘eval’ expression in Javascript. Yes, our final compressed file used the ‘eval’ expression with a property ‘devtool’ on the webpack config. The property ‘devtool’ shouldn’t be there when we using ‘dist’ mode to compile the final code for production environment.</p>
<p>That’s a totally mistake was made by myself. It made me so ashamed, especially when I saw the actually minified and mingled code after I fixed the problem.</p>
<p>So I decided to say sorry to my boss about that. Hope he could forgive my stupid words.</p>
<p>This experience taught me do not make a flag if you haven’t to investigate a problem. Otherwise, if you are wrong, the shame will always be with you.</p>

            <p>Sorry about that it’s too late to write now. And I am so sleepy, that means I have to make a brief for today then go bed to sleep.</p>
<p>I attempted the Angular2 celebrating meetup with my friends. But actually, there was no any attractive thingy during the speech. We just got some pizzas and beers as a dinner.</p>
<p>The speech just took us less than half hour, and there were two guys introduced that Angular2 had been released and where can we learn it. The second guy is an Indian. I cannot understand most of words from his mouth. Dude, please forgive me.</p>
<p>So, that is a boring meetup again. Hope someday I could meet a better one, and hope I could speak more smoothly to foreigners then.</p>
