        <div class="content">
            <p>I made some note by my understood from reading the cookbook of NG2 today. </p>
<p>Here is the note below:</p>
<p>AOT: Ahead of time<br>For compiling code before any browser load it. Used in Production.</p>
<p>Related:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rollup: The utility that do tree shaking. It only cares modules that have Import and Export statements.</li>
<li>ngc: A compiler that provided in the @angular/compiler-cli instead of the Typescript compiler. It has better performance than Typescript compiler for AOT mode in Angular2 application.</li>
<li>source-map-explorer: Analyse the source map generated with the bundle and draws a map of all dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Could reduce the HTTP requests of those resources which are individual dependencies.</li>
<li>Could do tree shaking to reduce unused portions of both source and library code.</li>
<li>Could improve the speed of loading and executing when first load the application with JIT.</li>
<li>Could uglify and mangle the final code.</li>
<li>It only produces one bundle script.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not be friendly with dev mode, it will be slower when the application code larger. And every time we modified the code, it has to be compiled entirely again. It will take a several seconds or more.</li>
</ol>
<p>JIT: Just in time<br>For compiling the app in browser runtime when it loads. Used in Development.</p>
<p>Related:</p>
<ol>
<li>SystemJS: It’s a ES module loader, and it could load any module format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is faster than compile everything in AOT mode so that it is better for the stage development.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>It relies on a browser runtime to compile everything after the source code loaded. That will delay the time could start to use by users.</li>
<li>It needs the angular compiler in browser, and the compiler is large and nearly equals to half size of the whole application code.</li>
<li>It uses SystemJS to load multiple sources such as templates, css and JS files. It might slower than only one bundle file being loaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, it’s the first time I use Keep today.</p>

            <p>I did some researches today for understanding how my girlfriend could come to here painless.</p>
<p>I studied from the official website of Australian Migration Department. And I found there is a way to apply a visa for a de facto partner, which must be a real partner and both of the proposers must provide the related evidence such as shared bank account and joint rent bills.</p>
<p>I also asked some details from an agency after work. The agency still recommended that we should get married before we apply for the visa. That’s because it is hard to get useful evidence from China, the AU government doesn’t accept any Chinese documents unless they could be notarized.</p>
<p>That is what I knew so far, and I will study more about the dependent visa application.</p>

            <p>I cannot believe marriage is so close to me. Each of my friends used to bet that I will be the last one who marries. The World is changing, and no one knows what a man will be in the next second.</p>
<p>For persuading my girlfriend to come to Melbourne with me, I took more than half year. There were only three roads appear on our eyes. I go back to Beijing, or she studies as a graduate student here to learn design two years, or we marry to apply a visa for her.</p>
<p>I know my girlfriend is not smart, she even has a little bit naive. I know she always goes back on her words. From the initial, she wants to study aboard in the USA. After a few months, she decided to go to Australia. At that time, she said she would get four 7 scores on IELTS test. I laughed at her and annoyed her. Nearly passed half year, she changed her mind to 6 scores. A few months later, she decided to get four 5 scores and to learn languages in AU before she studies in university. Finally, she got 4.5 scores and said to me she never wants to learn anymore, why I pushed her so much, and why she needs to waste the expensive tuition. In the meantime, she got a new interest again—Tattoo. Every day she told me she would be a tattooist, even though she never had the relative experience before two months ago.</p>
<p>Such a simple girl persuaded everyone includes her parents and me. Won’t learn anymore, and will marry to me to live together. I am not sure if I am sober. Maybe my mentality has changed in these years. I know she has such defects, but I still love her. Even though we might have argument sometimes, but most of the time we were happy together. She is such a kind and lovely girl; sometimes I even want a daughter like her. I don’t want a savvy woman to help me to construct our family and careers. She gives me happiness all the time, and I think that’s enough for getting a shared future.</p>
<p>This afternoon, she told her parents our ideas. Her parents truly love her more than me. They finally agreed her decision. If she actually doesn’t want to learn, why don’t give her freedom and happiness? I have already got an excellent opportunity to get the PR so that she doesn’t need to pay so much effort to come with me. That’s my duty to take care of her.</p>
<p>She told her parents that we might be able to get marriage certificate first. Then I could use it to apply a working visa for her to live in Melbourne. She could learn languages in some courses if she needs. Also, any free time she could learn and try to be a tattooist. If I were in China, I wouldn’t think about the idea a second. I’m not sure if it is a right way to make us happy or enjoyable for the future life. I hope we could figure out those tough issues during the road. If we need money, I will pay more efforts with my smart brain. If we need responsibility, I will learn and reflect more on what I did. Hope her could understand my heart.</p>
<p>As my imagination, to marry her after two or three years could be better. At that time, we could have the PR. I may get an ideal job. She will have a good English skill and a little work experience. That will make us learn more from each other; then we may know how hard to live in this cruel society and the world. It will be the best life experience to teach us how to cherish each other.</p>
<p>Finally, It would be better if she could study as a graduate student. That’s because I haven’t prepared anything about marriage. It is enormous pressure for me, and I don’t want to give my future wife a cheap memory.</p>
<p>Stress!</p>

            <p>Hmm… I lost my words again. Paid a whole night to try the recently best sold game NI-OH. Since there are so many articles says how good the NI-OH is, and IGN even gave it a 9.6 high score, so I cannot help to check if it is indeed an amazing game. By the way, the NI-OH has been sold out in Japan.</p>
<p>The NI-OH seems like the game Bloodborne. You can find lots of similar features between they both. For example, in NI-OH you only have one life, if you died, you have only one opportunity to pick up the souls(kill enemies could gain their souls just like Dark Souls) you lost in which you died. But if you died during the road again, you will lose the souls that you had gained forever.</p>
<p>Also, the NI-OH has similar difficulty with Bloodborne. Unless you use the unique skill—by collecting anger and killing lots of enemies, otherwise you could be killed by any of medium-level enemies with their combos.</p>
<p>It’s a good game, but it cannot be compared with Bloodborne or Dark Souls. It’s more like Dark Souls 2. I don’t like so many enemies in a complicated map.</p>

            <p>After the long journey reunited with my friends and relatives, I got full energy to face the next year which will be hard by someone as a leader in my work.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, there will be an important meeting for showing what will we do at the next year. Hope everything could be fine as we normal guys thinking rather than some silly ideas by someone.</p>
<p>The journal continues, and I will also add some new daily plans for this year.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
