            <p>About Three months ago, I got a requirement for deploying our project from backend developers. The requirement is they need a separated config file which should not be included in the final bundle file. That means the separated config file cannot go through the build flow of Webpack to do some tasks such as compression and combination.</p>
<p>The requirement actually doesn’t make sense all the time. I asked those guys many times why we cannot use different environments by adding some parameters in our build scripts so that we could just easy to compile the same project with different settings. However, those guys don’t like anything about CLI. They don’t care using which way to do it will be better.</p>
<p>Since I really don’t want to do some silly works like this, so I put off the task until today.</p>
<p>At first, I just created an individual config file to hold those keys about API or region settings. All the configs have a fallback to the environment which registered in our computer before. So that if you don’t have an external config file, the application will work with the setting which you specified in your computer—also they are written in different ENV config files.</p>
<p>But I changed my mind immediately. That’s because the separated file might be able to make a cache issue—user may not get the latest config if there is a cache on the server. Since we’ve used Webpack, if we don’t follow the rules of Webpack workflow, we might get some limitation there. For example, the final bundle file is easy to add a hash as a postfix to bust cache, but it’s not easy to just give the same hash postfix to a separated config file, which also shouldn’t go through the process of build workflow.</p>
<p>Even if I could find some ugly ways to make it possible that add the same hash as the postfix for the separated config file. If the backend guys just want to keep lazy and only change the separated config file without compilation in the “dist” folder, then they just deploy the code to the server again, all things will be broken.</p>
<p>So I just move the code of the separated config file to inline script in the index.html. Yet I still got an answer “no.” They even didn’t want to see my code and just kept their stupid solution as a bible. How can I do in the fucking team? There is always a dictator with his silly ideas to prevent me from doing something normal or better.</p>
<p>We may argue about one hour for the issue. I just put the scenario like what I mentioned above to those guys. And they seemed got what I worried. Then a guy told me, he could compile all code before he changes the config file so that we don’t need to worry about if the cache doesn’t update.</p>
<p>It sounds right uh? But if we have to compile everything before changing the individual config file, why we need the file itself? I was totally devastated because everything returns to my initial recommendation which from three months before. I asked them again, “why don’t we use a standard way to handle the different environments like many other companies?” They just quibbled to me and gave me an answer “you have to do it like what we said.”</p>
<p>Can you feel that? I just want to fuck the team and fuck the dying programmers. When can I get rid of those people? Only God and the warden knows.</p>

            <p>I should have written something about Australian Express Mall Service, but since PSN HongKong brought a few funny games for PSN members this month, so I cannot wait to play the latest free games.</p>
<p>There is a new free game named Magicka 2. The first generation of the game I have played when I was in college. There is no many changes in the second generation. The most interesting part in this game is you can combine a variety of magic from some basic magical elements. It will make you scramble especially there are lots of enemies surround you.</p>
<p>Another attractive feature in the game is to play it with multiple players online. I played Magicka 2 with my friend tonight. In the game, we always kill each other accidentally but also revive each other among the enemies. You cannot imagine how funny the scenarios were.</p>
<p>It’s too late now, I have to sleep now for tomorrow’s work. So I just leave some careless words above to record my enjoyable night.</p>

            <p>As what I expected yesterday, the warden brought a heap of unreasonable ideas to us. He tried to force us to follow everything from his mind, but only one thing you could get from him is that you cannot imagine how arrogant a man could be.</p>
<p>We three Chinese guys argued with him a whole afternoon. Even though he didn’t have any valuable argument, he still wasted our time by his quibble.</p>
<p>He wants to split we front-end guys to different projects—as he just wants to make every project has a person who is totally responsible for the project itself. So that if our boss asks us a specific problem on any projects, then the warden can just easy to put the issue to someone.</p>
<p>That means if there is an issue, someone must be guilty.</p>
<p>That also means we cannot do the part of what we are good at in a project. Each front-end developer must implement all features throughout a whole project, whatever the build workflow, library choose, code style, basic structure, fancy component, you name it. It is absolutely ineffective for us—only two front-end developers—and one is a newbie.</p>
<p>If there is a project which is totally written by one person that might work with his silly idea. But all projects in our company are written by a team. How could make one person totally understand every detail in the project by others? That is impossible. What if one developer has to maintain and change some code on the work by others? He/She may be able to implement the changes, but there might be side effects around there as well. Someday when the original code author found the reason of the side effects, the author may have to rewrite the code which changed by the previous maintainer.</p>
<p>Such an ineffective strategy. You cannot believe that it comes from a man who called himself a software architect. Doesn’t he feel shameful? This is a small company which only have five developers in it. If I have to work with somebody like him, I’d rather drink poison. But I don’t have any choice due to I am still in the jail.</p>
<p>I cannot get the personality which is arrogant and ignorant from some nations, but wish I can get rid of those nations in my future work.</p>
<p>Another thing is if we split our front-end team, which indicates one developer could do everything from top to bottom. That also means I could be fired painless anytime by the warden when he feels unhappy with me.</p>
<p>That’s it, the new life in jail has come again.</p>

            <p>Will tears as the lead is going to back office tomorrow. I will remember those two happy weeks forever when he didn’t stay in the office. Thank God gave me those days without him so that I could fish in troubled water and keep relaxing.</p>
<p>For celebrating that we Chinese guys got rid of the lead’s control, or maybe I should say the warden’s control, we took more than two hours to have a sumptuous lunch—the best Korean fried chicken in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the next two weeks I will be fine in work, but the good news is Christmas day is coming, and they all will have an extended leave so that maybe I don’t have something annoying need to do. But that’s just my optimistic hope.</p>
<p>No matter what will come after he backs, I will try my best to live in the jail.</p>

            <p>Our tester came up with an unreasonable requirement when she tested our work. She thinks as a user she expects that the size of drag&amp;drop zone should be changed by a specific image size. What a silly thought I cannot believe it was put forward by our ‘professional’ tester. So I wrote an email to try to explain why it is an unreasonable requirement and why we should not implement it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For drag&amp;drop zone. I think we don’t need to make its shape related to a particular image size, which is unreasonable in component architecture. Before we reflect on whether a feature or an improvement will look better, we should think if it is reasonable first.<br>&nbsp;<br>At this scenario, the drag&amp;drop zone as a better uploading component will improve the user experience. But it is basically an uploading component first. We should keep every component as possible as pure so that we could easily to maintain and reuse them in the future. That means the business logic should not pollute those components which have a single purpose, such as the uploading component.<br>&nbsp;<br>The shape of drag&amp;drop zone is designed for helping user drag and drop their files handily. That’s why the zone is big enough. If the size of the zone depends on a particular image size, it will bring us more issues on the stability of the project. For example, drag&amp;drop doesn’t know what the size it will accept from users’ choice. If the size is small, it will make user inconvenient to drop the files. If the size is too large(I noticed there would be images has the size of 800x160), keep the same behavior will be unexpected and unreasonable in design. That’s why we shouldn’t implement the ‘improvement.’ Because If the further image size is accepted, then the rule of this improvement will be totally failed. And users may also feel confused with its changeful size.<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why I don’t think it’s a tradeoff or an improvement on user experience. Before we analyze the look and feel of a requirement from user’s perspective, we should think about if it is reasonable first. The user finally will understand why we did like those rather than totally matched their thoughts at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I received the reply like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand. Thank you for your explanation.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would still like to run this by Kaveh/Yee at a later time as a design consideration for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I talked with a duck? Why I need to take so much effort to try to persuade someone who doesn’t care about my serious thought. Am I only a worker who always listens to the orders from others even the orders are incredibly foolish?</p>
<p>Only God knows what I am doing in this babyish but infighting company. And only one thing I can do is continue to stay in jail.</p>

            <p>Don’t know why my right knee was twisted yesterday. It’s painful, and I cannot easy to go upstairs. I got the similar accident more than three times in the past year. I’m not sure if I have a problem with my knees. I should check it when I return to Beijing.</p>
<p>My father in law made a surgery these days, to cut a melanoma in his external auditory meatus. The surgical result is good, and the wound is small. For now, he is still lying on hospital bed, and there are some relatives nearby to accompany him. My girlfriend also visits him every day. Hope he could get well as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The disease is the worst thing during our life. To prevent if someday we got a critical illness, we’d better do exercise more frequently and do physical examination every year. Otherwise, no life to play will be the most woeful thing.</p>

            <p>I did dozens of requirements for improving some user experiences on our website KDP. Since tomorrow is the final day for our front-end guys to handle code and ready to deploy. So there were lots of colleagues became product managers to criticize our work and put their unthoughtful opinions anytime. I am angry with that behavior by others. If you really care about our work, please put your opinions or ideas before nearing the day when we need to release the final project.</p>
<p>Felt tired in this small infighting company.</p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
