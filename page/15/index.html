            <p>I have code more than 12 hours today. Now I am tired and I just want to go bed to sleep.</p>
<p>Xibo is a good partner even if he didn’t have so much experiences in front-end. But he is smart and he knows how to learn techniques. At the mean time, he also works hard especially when I ask for him if he could work over time.</p>
<p>For our urgent deadline, for our professional project, and for my personal ideal, I chose working over time to implement the product as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say this day. Hope the tomorrow we could achieve more tasks.</p>
<p>Bless me could saving some time.</p>

            <p>Finally, I sent the girl away from the Melbourne Airport. She will arrive in Beijing tomorrow morning. We could have five months or more to separate.</p>
<p>I took a SkyBus to return to my home. And I tried to clean every corner to forget something sad. But her pictures are around over the home. I can’t help to miss her. That made me so depressed. I even wanted to buy an air ticket then resign from my company to catch her.</p>
<p>But I cannot do that. I know something here I have to do. I need seek something that I really want.</p>
<p>After a deep cleaning for the room, I made a call for my friends. We talked so many matters about our next five years. We have so much pressure for normal life, I am truly want to be drunk for now.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have to return back to the previous single life. There might be a same dish cooked by myself again and again, until she comes once more.</p>
<p>Goodbye my lover, and see you in the tomorrow morning. Thanks for the WeChat too.</p>

            <p>So sad today. Sweet time is always short. I have to say goodbye to my lover tomorrow.</p>
<p>We nearly used a whole day to embrace with each other. We went to a market to bought some snacks for her friends. Most of them are TimTam chocolates, because I heard it is the famous snack in Australia, so we bought them a lot.</p>
<p>After that, we went to the restaurant Rich Papa again. But at this time I decided to choose something new. I used to choose a same food if I tasted it well at the first time. My girlfriend is in another extreme, she always likes to try some new kinds of foods. It has a high risk. So that sometimes she got some foods delicious, sometimes she got a food hard to swallow.</p>
<p>This time, I wanted to follow her. After ordered the food, suddenly my tears were flowed around in my eyes. I love the girl, and I swore I will never separate from her again. If the next time I have to work in another city in this world, she must be followed me everyday. I cannot bear any day I left her.</p>
<p>We packed her baggages in the evening. Even if she was still at home, I was so miss her. We took some photos with Polaroid, and stuck those photos on somewhere I could easily face to. For example, I could see her on the mirror of the wash room, I could see her was brushing her teeth on the picture when I am doing the same thing.</p>
<p>We stuck ten of pictures to different position. In every image she was smiling. At least that will make me comfort.</p>
<p>I love you my dear, let us cherish the last day you will be here.</p>

            <p>So busy today. For now I am so tired and sleepy, so I don’t have passion to keep a meaningful journal today.</p>
<p>We have tried the angular1.5 with component architecture for our new project. And it works fine for we guys. There just are a few issues about Webpack took us some time actually.</p>
<p>I like the component architecture of Angular2 better than React&amp;Redux. Because the Ng2 gives use more possibility to control some specific rules but it still supports all of essential services for a whole SPA lifecycle. For example, we could use two-way binding on some right situations, we could separate content, style and behaviour to different files. I like that rather than coupling those three parts in one block.</p>
<p>Another thing interesting is our team got a lunch together today. Our boss took us to a Chinese restaurant, which serves delicious snacks from Guangdong. The snacks are really tasty, maybe I should take my girlfriend to eat them tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just a normal Friday, there is nothing need to record, cause I am too tired to write anymore.</p>
<p>Good Night!</p>

            <p>Maybe today is the day I spoke most. Nearly the whole day from morning to evening I was talking. Because I need to figure out all of the requirements and the interactions from the product, which is our next project KDP.</p>
<p>That is a successful step as the beginning of the KDP. All I need is just to build everything professional with my experiences. Even if we have to take over time to work to guarantee the product could be released at the precise delivery deadline.</p>
<p>In this morning, there was a conversation for all of the team members. But it just like the leader wanted to complain something like a child. It sounds like: “Come on guys, yesterday such both guys accused me to our boss, and they want to get authorities for themselves. How would you think it? Please choose and stand in line.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why a guy R speak on behalf for the leader so much. Maybe they are always in the same boat. They might be cannot catch our three Chinese guys in techniques. But they want to keep their position and stay lazy and cheap. Because they don’t want to change anything, they just enjoy their current relaxing shitty work.</p>
<p>How hard I was fighting for the basic workflow. It should be easy originally. I just want to take a code review for a week on the colleague Xibo’s code. Only him need to be reviewed, and only one week we need to do this way. But the leader always limited us do it. I don’t know how many times I begged for the leader. I said I could create a private repository on Github, we both just need it to review code during one week, after that, we will transfer the repo totally to Amazon CodeCommit.</p>
<p>But the man always says you can’t do that. “Can we integrate a code review tool on JIRA? ” Or “can we switch to use Bitbucket?”. The similar things usually cheesed me. Because I know Github, Xibo knows Github, and only we both will develop the project KDP. Why have we to learn such complicated things from the leader’s advice? We just want to do code review a few times! Do not control us with his babyish technical knowledge ok? If he doesn’t know Git, that’s fine we don’t care, because we don’t need write code with him on front-end project. If he doesn’t know how to build a private git dashboard distribution, that’s fine, and there are two Chinese guys know how to host the system on our internal server. If you know nothing, but you still want to reject any reasonable advice, finally you want to give us some useless recommended technical solutions, but you never used before. Why hire me to here? I am not the worker for your all shitty tasks. If you want to prevent me work for a product better, just let me quit. I don’t want to be with you on those annoying things.</p>
<p>I don’t know why such a small startup has so many harmful factors. Someone wants to protect own interests. I don’t know what does it meaningful when you have so many titles like Software Architect, Product Manager, Project Manager, and Founder just on such a small company? There were just two developers before!</p>
<p>If you feel happy to reject me again and again, and always let me do some shitty things. I could quit anytime without any pressure.</p>
<p>Whatever we finally secure the right is that we bought an enterprise account from Github. That means we could use Github now to do something professional, that is an essential step to make procedure and product better.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to find all of the questions about the latest design with Xibo. We summarized many confusing issues for interactions and business logics. Then we asked for our designer and the leader more than 2 hours to figure out all of the things.</p>
<p>The deadline is close, but hope we could confirm something! If we did it better than before, then we still suffer the same bad things, I will quit without hesitation.</p>

<p>Even if I have so many words want to say today, but I have to take a shower then go to bed. Because I have a new challenge. I cannot be defeated by someone.</p>
<p>Yes, I have argued with the leader during the whole morning. And I tried to expose all of his bad parts and the influences he did in the company. The argument was so drastic, I even said If you force me to do the shit, I can quit now.</p>
<p>The leader said,  “If you try to interrupt me any word, you could quite now”.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Interesting. I don’t know this city. I don’t know why this city has such a kind of bad lier in the position where doesn’t belong to him.</p>
<p>Maybe quit is a better choice for me. Who cares the lier?  Hope I can make the new project best.</p>

            <p>After bearing an ignorant leader again and again. Today, I finally broke out my anger to my boss.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, my colleague Xibo told me our leader assigned a new task to him. The task is about creating a front-end project for our new advertisement distribution system. Our leader let Xibo to create a basic structure and workflow for this new system. Although I don’t think the leader know what is the front-end workflow as his unprofessional technical knowledges.</p>
<p>I was unpleasant for the silly decision. Because I don’t know why no one told me anything about such so important new system. We don’t know what is the deadline and what is the original requirements. If Xibo didn’t tell me the new task he had been assigned, I will get angry after two weeks later when I finished my current work then joining his new project. That’s because Xibo as a newbie of front-end developer, he doesn’t have so many relative knowledges and experiences to hold the basic structure. I cannot understand why the leader doesn’t choose me to discuss how to implement such an important front-end project. Does he think he knows everything on web techniques? Or does he suppose the new system is easy? I just don’t want to expose how bad he as a software engineer to the whole company for now.</p>
<p>And, he even think he is a technical architect. What an incredible joke! Is there doesn’t have any software engineer in Australia? I can’t believe how he could cheat so many kind colleagues such long time. With his unprofessional and unrestrained structure ideas, the company Kakku would be died soon or later.</p>
<p>The leader is always make me restricted. I have so much passion to here to help our team get a better front-end technical environment, but he treat me like a cleaner. I cannot know what is the customer’s requirements. I cannot know what is the deadline to delivery a product. I even cannot control the specific technical solution on front-end. He is so irresponsive to hold everyone to make a product like a shit.</p>
<p>Yes, he is using JIRA to manage the progress of all of projects. But use the JIRA like what he did, I’d rather use a note to manage it. Because in JIRA, no one has any authority to write a new task for themselves. He as a dictator has all of authorities to control everything, but he just assigned a cursory task for everyone. A task may take 1 or 2 weeks. Is that a task for project? No, that is a useless shit for his lazy and dictating personal interest.</p>
<p>I am here just for working for my boss Yee, If I want to do every better thing for Kakku but restricted by the leader. I’d rather go back to China.</p>
<p>So I went to the boss’s office with Xibo after got off work. I showed him my attitude, which I don’t want to be controled by such the leader. If the new project is urgent, we would rather take overtime on work with a right and professional way. I cannot accept his any unprofessional advice on our work. He doesn’t have any competence to dictate his wrong technical orders on us.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Yee will tell the leader tomorrow morning. I hope it is useful. If not, maybe I have to quit at someday I cannot bear the lier anymore.</p>
<p>Hope Kakku is better, and hope my work is valuable in the future.</p>

            <p>The weather in Melbourne is capricious. You could see both sunshine and rain at the same time. Sometimes in the morning there is hot, while it would be cold in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Today, I have had such a rainy day. At noon, I got up from my chair to have lunch — my girlfriend had already cooked for me.</p>
<p>When I opened the office door, the light rain suddenly became heavy. Even if I had a cheap umbrella to prevent the torrential rain drench my clothes. After 7 minutes, when I got home, my pants, my shoes, and even my socks are all wet. No one can predict what weather would be next second. Because after I got in my home, the rain was suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>However, when I prepared to come back to the office, the rain was coming again. I had to change a suit and a pair of boots to avoid drenching one more time.</p>
<p>In the office, my desk is facing a window. During the whole afternoon, I was facing to a bright sunshine without any raindrop. What a capricious rain, no one could explain it.</p>
<p>Finally, when I got off work, the rain came back to a light version again, just like in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people said that you could not predict the weather in Melbourne because any gust of wind will change everything.</p>

            <p>I’m not a man who likes gossip. But recently there was a funny news broke out everywhere. Chinese actor BaoQiang Wang prepared to divorce with his wife Rong Ma. He said he has enough evidence to prove Rong was derailed with his broker.</p>
<p>The news is breaking out in China, everybody is interested in it. The attention of this news is even higher than Rio Olympics these days. Nobody could explain why so many people like to pay attention on other’s private affair. As for me, I even downloaded a news App 今日头条 to catch the latest news from BaoQiang. Why I am so interested in this gossip? What’s wrong with me? I cannot explain it too. I am just curious about it, and I always want to heard some new stories are extremely bad or incredible.</p>
<p>I just want to see the dark side of humanity. And see it though BaoQiang is more presentative. It would be actually satisfied me.</p>
<p>I don’t know who is right and who has true evidence. The only thing I care about is how deep our online friends could dig on this thing.</p>
<p>The ideal ending I am expected is that BaoQiang is a calculating and manipulative man. He lied everybody with his compassionate letter and he just wanted to divorce with his wife to get a new relation with others. I hope he had known everything before he posted the divorced statement. And I hope he knew the trend of public opinions would be totally controlled by himself. Until a few months or a few years later, someone try to explore the truth of the whole thing. Maybe at that time, all of views from these people today would be broken by the mind shock.</p>
<p>I am really expected a reverse story. God please make it come true.</p>

            <p>This Saturday we went to the Melbourne zoo. Although the sky was blue, sometimes there still be slight rain. However, it didn’t appear a beautiful rainbow.</p>
<p>With my girlfriend Dog Xuan, we took the tram 55 which would end to West Coburg from the stop nearby our apartment. There were a few people on the route, nearly all of them would be going to the Melbourne zoo just like us.</p>
<p>After half an hour, we arrived at the gate of the zoo. The ticket price is $30 for per visitor. It is reasonable and valuable I suppose, because there are many staffs in the zoo take care of our safety, and the environment there. They also need to train some animals friendly. So that we could see those cute animals relaxing and happy.</p>
<p>From the entry gate, we got a small map on hand. The map just like a maze, there are a few different routes sometimes made us confused. We started with a rightward route, although it was opposite from most of visitors. Actually, we chose the rightward route just because it is closer to Koala and Kangaroo. They are the most famous animals in Australia. You won’t easy to see them in any other zoo especially in China.</p>
<p>Melbourne zoo is a Xanadu. Every place that a kind of animals lived is totally different. Some of them allow you contact with animals closely, you even can touch them, such as tortoise. Others you have to see via a window or fence. For example, you can only see all kinds of monkeys via a window, because they are sometimes dangerous.</p>
<p>There is a special corridor where grows lots of different trees. Various birds perched on them. We can’t recognise what name of any bird, but we really envied them. If I was a bird living in there, I will be indulged in the paradise.</p>
<p>We also saw a show from a seal, by its feeder. Yes, there still are some aquatic creatures in the zoo, just living in a specific aquarium.</p>
<p>After made a big circle route in the zoo, we finally took 2 hours to finish seeing most of cute animals. Since the map was so confusing, we still missed some lovely animals like big cats and tigers.</p>
<p>Have to say the Melbourne zoo is a recommended place if you’re in this city. It’s an absolutely paradise.</p>
