            <p>Sorry guys, it is another game day. I played the Bloodborne until 3 a.m. And for now, my girlfriend is giving me a call, so I have to make the journal short. And it’s indeed nothing worth to record.</p>
<p>I have to say the game producer Hidetaka Miyazaki is an artist. The game Bloodborne and Dark Souls are totally artworks. They are worth to spend your all free time on them. If you’ve played them, you will understand my feeling.</p>
<p>I still decide to play at tomorrow because I have almost finished it. There are only two final bosses are waiting for me. I don’t have any interest in other things.</p>

            <p>I just wrote a long email to ask for leave during Chinese New Year. It should also be my journal today, so I move it to below.</p>
<p>Hi Yee,</p>
<p>I felt a little bit depressed about you said that we’d better ask for a leave shorter than two weeks. Since Xibo was there, so some words I couldn’t tell you. But I think I have to let you know.</p>
<p>I made a plan for a month leave because I still have 19 days of annual leaves. And I also recorded I’ve worked overtime more than 44 hours. That should be equal to 5 days. It means I could have 24 workdays to leave for the next half year.</p>
<p>You know I don’t have friends or family here, so I don’t have anything worth to ask leave. But as an employee, I should have right to use the leave rather than work constantly. That’s why I am always working hard because I want to get rest with my girlfriend, family, and friends when I live my vocation. That will return fairness to my hard work, and it also makes me full of passion on work.</p>
<p>But I also know in a company, to allow an employee to leave a month might be dangerous, especially during the normal working days. Since Chinese New Year is usually in February. Ask for leave during those days may disturb others work. And I think that’s why Ruby could ask for a leave nearly a month because it is during the Christmas, no one works here, and there is nothing to do. I understand the situation. It is an interesting problem I’ve never thought.</p>
<p>That means maybe I have to have a long vacation during Christmas even though I have nothing to do. Ideally, I just want to spend the statutory holidays then save my personal days of leave for Chinese New Year. It seems maybe I have to compromise for our company.</p>
<p>But can we figure out a better solution? Because this Chinese New Year is important to me. You know the Chinese Year is the biggest holiday, it nearly continues half month. I will take my girlfriend to my home; she will see my hometown and my family and my friends. It is important to us. I wish you could understand. And you also know my hometown is Xinjiang. It is long travel from Beijing to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>I need to see friends in Beijing, then we need to see her family in Hebei, then we need to take a flight to Urumqi to see my relatives, then we need to take a flight to my hometown Yining to see my family and friends. You’ll see that indeed needs a long vacation. And that’s why I felt depressed. But I understand you, and I also know my work is important to the company.</p>
<p>Or, can I work outside if you guys need me to develop something? I think I could cover that because the vacation for me is not just to play. Most of the time we just need to see some people(relatives, old friends) or have a dinner with them. I think I have enough time to work.</p>
<p>If one month is still unacceptable for you, can we make it three weeks? Two weeks are too short for those personal affairs. Of course, one month is the best for me. You know when I told my girlfriend that I might only get two weeks vacation she nearly cried.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to make sure with you is whether the annual leave would be expired after July? If it does, I want to use them out before the next July. Or maybe the leave could be exchanged to payment? I don’t know, hope you could tell me that. After all, no one likes work hard in an unfair environment. I don’t want to work hard and lose my leave then see others enjoy their vacation and keep lazy on work. I think you understand the feeling.</p>
<p>thanks,<br>Yang</p>

<p>I don’t want to write anything today because I just want to save more time to play. Please forgive my sorrow. You will get the same feeling someday. Nothing worth to do but excellent games!</p>

            <p>It is another ineffective workday. The only one voice in my head persuaded me do not be angry at the words from someone who is extremely amateur. Even though he expressed like there was a discussion among the whole team, we all know that was just a show by himself. The decision had been made by him before the discussion began.</p>
<p>I have been programming four years more, but I never saw amateur stuff like they did. It seems like we three Chinese guys are always company a rude baby to create some kinds of shitty toys.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why he insisted on keeping two API calls for rendering a list in front-end. We just want to use one call for fetching a list of data to render the Advertisement list. They said some parts of data they have to fetch from another service. That’s why we have to make multiple calls to get the data. Why can’t they choose a cache server to fetch the 3rd-party service automatically? No one knows why. Maybe they know nothing.</p>
<p>Even though our Chinese backend guy gave him many recommendations to make the shitty works one call. But he still tried to find some stupid and weird reasons to reject the significant advice.</p>
<p>I think business in architecture should be layered. Each part of them has a proper position. For this evil decision, it is totally an excuse for making someone keep lazy and relaxing. They just want to put the messy business logic to front-end. Front-end is just a layer view, why it should handle the messy business logic which should have written in the backend? The only answer to me might be they know nothing about how to be a professional programmer and what should they do with a right way in software engineering.</p>
<p>God is blessing them that they are working in an incredibly lazy country. If any of them tries to find a good job in China, they will be rejected a thousand of times.</p>
<p>They pay me money anyway, how can I fight for myself to refuse the silly amateur solution? I’m just fucked and kept the fucking happy mood every day.</p>

            <p>I’ve already tried to learn something about Sketch. I read some articles tonight, but I am still confused with each corner on the panel of Sketch. I even feel it only works for smartphones or tablets. There is few resource about web design on Sketch tutorials.</p>
<p>Even though I had nothing improved on my path to learning design, I got some shocking views about Chinese girls on a business called overseas purchasing. It was an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>My nephew was born five months ago, so my sister wants me to buy some milk powder and baby food for her son. Everyone in China knows that milk powder in there is unsafe because too many businesses in China are totally conscienceless. And Australia is one of a major exporter of agriculture. So the milk powder in Australia is attractive to Chinese.</p>
<p>You can’t believe every corner of this city must have a Chinese delivery store. One box can be filled with three cans of milk powder. That is an unspoken rule for each Chinese student here. Especially a bunch of girls. No one knows how much tax they have evaded. According to an investigation by the government, the estimated value is one hundred million per year.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter to me I thought then. I just wanted to buy a few cans of milk powder, a few bottles of Calcium, and a few bags of baby rice.</p>
<p>However, I was utterly failed. I figured out nothing except two bottles of fish oil in the two of largest chemist’s shops here. All of what I wanted to buy were out of stock. The only valuable stuff on the empty shelf was its price tag. How can I get them from the Chinese hands?</p>
<p>Yes, the answer is to buy them from a Chinese shop.</p>
<p>Finally, I got everything from a Chinese overseas purchasing store. And they even provide a service to deliver the packages to China. They got the victory, but I got the sweat.</p>
<p>What the fuck today, it took me nearly three hours to search that essential stuff of life, then the result is I have to pay the money back to Chinese. Holy ironic.</p>

            <p>To be an artist is my dream all the time. I never changed my primal interests during these years in a cruel society, although I have to earn money from some shitty works for life.</p>
<p>I love music; I love writing, and I surely love the design as well. That’s why I decided to be a front-end programmer when I was learning software engineering in university. I never thought someday the career will be hot, and the related practitioners will be understaffed. So that It even makes it possible I could live in another country at the moment. Rather than most of the recent front-end guys who just learned from some amateur training courses a few months then try to find a job with high salary.</p>
<p>I chose to be a front-end guy just because I love the work to show my crafts to others. I like exquisite and high-quality stuff with a rich sense of design. To implement the GUI artworks could satisfy me deeply. That’s why I found a way different to others when my university didn’t have the related courses.</p>
<p>This year, I don’t know if I am lazy or I am becoming more and more conservative. I even feel boring sometimes when there are a bunch of similar libraries newborn but have same principles with before. It is more like a victory of sales rather than to make artworks better. I cannot pay them my passion on, to catch up the new wine in an old bottle made me tired and unhappy.</p>
<p>These days I gradually to find some articles about UI design, some artworks shocked me. I can’t help sharing them with my girlfriend. I try to analyze some details to her to show how the design is excellent in my opinion. Since I don’t have professional knowledge on design, so I always think I don’t have confidence on my comments. Because I am a programmer, I know every career has a huge mountain behind. You can’t just think about them above the surface then give somebody comments irresponsibly.</p>
<p>So I asked my girl if I am so happy with design rather than tired to catch the dull and similar techniques on front-end, why can’t I try to learn something about design? At least, it should be better than playing games every weekend to me. We all supposed that I should learn design and do some artworks by myself. Even though the artworks could be shit, it will make my step to interest closer at least.</p>

            <p>There is a bad news that the PS VR I’ve already preordered has been delayed to deliver, and the estimated date of shipment is due in Dec 2016. Please be happy with my sorrow.</p>
<p>Since Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in literature yesterday, I am curious about how excellent writing does he have. I cannot actually understand the poems from his lyrics and his duck-like voice. Even though I heard his songs from junior high school, and I also know lots of his stories. So I decided to find a biography of himself.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called Bob Dylan Chronicles, it describes his legendary life during the luminous period when he made folk music revive in America. He was indeed a talent in that era. I suppose I could feel a few elegant sentences in his writing, it is easygoing rather than obscure.</p>
<p>When he described an environment, he wrote a paragraph like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out side the wind was blowing, straggling cloud wisps, snow whirling in the red lanterned streets, city types scuffling around, bundled up — salesmen in rabbit fur earmuffs hawking gimmicks, chestnut vendors, steam rising out of manholes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a picture of the sense around you when you read the paragraph, isn’t it? It just like yo u lived with him in the story.</p>
<p>However, when he wrote about himself, it comes with below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I was playing at the time were hard-lipped folk songs with fire and brimstone servings, and you didn’t need to take polls to know that they didn’t match up with anything on the radio, didn’t lend themselves to commercialism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could find a little ridicule on his words, the sentences are concise with a little sharp.</p>
<p>Since my reading speed is still slow, so I just read a few pages on the sample of the book. I wish I could read more if I have time. Because he is a hero and a true star to me, I am interested to learn more from his writing to know what did he think in his legendary past.</p>

            <p>Since daylight saving has become, the sunset is getting more late everyday. After one hour overtime, there was still light outside. So I decided to buy some food from market.</p>
<p>There was a little wind with warm sunshine. I walked relaxedly and a few songs of Coldplay were around my head. I can’t help to take a breath then, everything on the road was fresh to me.</p>
<p>I became to think what is my final destination. Beijing? Melbourne? Sydney or a city in US? I don’t know if every step is safe to my future. But I indeed enjoyed the moment I can feel everything comfortable within the beautiful city.</p>
<p>That might be a dreaming island parts of you want to be in, isn’t it? So I should be satisfied even though there are some shitty work are waiting for me all the time. I am a fortunate guy, I have such an opportunity to break out GFW to live in a free and clean island. It should have been a pleasant experience. I need to stop complaining more and to enjoy the truly free time.</p>
