            <p>Let me celebrate my first Christmas holiday. It is going to become from tomorrow. Even though I have no plan on holiday, I still feel happy with that—I do not need to see some guys during these two weeks.</p>
<p>My boss invited us to have a brunch this morning. We chose a Korean restaurant and ate from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. It’s nearly a whole workday. We just worked less than half hours after we went back to the office, and left early.</p>
<p>Melbourne is Paradise! No one wants to work today. Let’s enjoy life.</p>

            <p>I just turned to play the game Helldivers again. Since the game Magicka2 made my friends and me excited online. So we decided to play the similar best online game Helldivers on PS4 in 2015.</p>
<p>My account has only eight levels, and my friend is totally a newbie. We were fucked by those zergs again and again. Even though sometimes there was a high-level guy could help us out of danger, finally we would pull up his/her socks to make tasks failed. No wonder no one wanted to fight with us more than one battle.</p>
<p>We liked to choose challenging battles, but the high-level enemies always taught us how to be human. We were killed by some giant zergs thousands of times, but we didn’t give up. I don’t mean if we insist on fighting with those powerful enemies more times then we could get a victory. We just never give up, but always keep died.</p>
<p>No matter what, it’s a funny game. We will play it tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I have already equiped everything I need in my home for celebrating this “Otaku” holiday. My colleague Barry helped me delivered a desk from IKEA, and another colleague Xibo helped to lift the new TV on this new desk. With these guys’ generous help, I finally could enjoy the best cozy environment. I need to invite them to a meal tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, I am still confused how these heavy stuff are going to be transferred to a new home by my hand. Let me have a relaxing holiday and enjoy them first. And I bet my girlfriend will kill when she saw everything I bought these two months.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to celebrate the Christmas Day. Hope time flows speedily.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I was shocked by a Korean movie The Handmaiden today. The film is adapted from a novel Fingersmith. It describes a suspenseful love story among a cheater, a maid, and a noble lady.</p>
<p>I admire the director Park Chan-wook of the movie from two years ago. He is absolutely a genius on directing movies. He was well-known for people by his famous Revenge trilogy: Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, and Lady Vengeance. If you have seen the trilogy before, you will find he is pretty like to direct B-movie. But the movie The Handmaiden got win-win between business and art.</p>
<p>I like movies directed by Park Chan-wook especially like what the shots (such as Long Take) controlled by him. And the taste of BGM as well. He always likes to tell you a story with dozens of reversals, but he finally could make sense on each part.</p>
<p>There is a shot impressed me. We often could see films to express the situation that time is flowing by a shot of a running clock. But how does Park Chan-wook direct it? He just keeps everyone sits on chairs, and control the environment lightness from light to dark, then back to light again. It just like sometimes a cloud blocks the sunshine but will reveal it after a few minutes. I cannot help to praise him when I saw the way to express time flowing.</p>
<p>I don’t want to give you any spoiler on the movie. It is an art, and also is the best movie in 2016 in my opinion.</p>
<p>I don’t know why Korean Movies are such great. But at least, there are lots of shitty Chinese Movies could be taken as carpets to make those overseas arts shining.</p>
<p>By the way, another film I watched today is a totally shit. It called Inferno. Don’t pay for that, and don’t spend your time on it as well.</p>

            <p>I was playing games a whole day in my new HDR TV. The HDR is amazing technology which will make black be more black and white be more white. You even can see each hair in games by Naughty Dogs.</p>
<p>Even though I got those luxurious devices and I really enjoy them, actually I know I am blameful. Look around my cozy home, you will find nothing in there is essential for my personal life. I don’t need them, and I also don’t have so much time to spend on each expensive stuff that I bought. I shouldn’t bought them but I have already did that. That makes me felt guilty for both myself and my girlfriend. So I promised to her that I won’t buy any useless fancy stuff before she comes in the next year.</p>
<p>I repent those my stupid behaviours in this half year. And I really wish I could do something significant to reduce my guilt.</p>

            <p>It is an email I sent to my boss this morning. It records something puzzled me while I work in the company.</p>
<p>Hi Yee,</p>
<p>Please don’t tell anyone this email I will send to you. I just want to let you know what my feeling is.</p>
<p>Do you remember the auto-generate title format? It is an extremely simple feature. I just used two minutes to implement it. And it was finished yesterday as your final requirement.</p>
<p>But I received a change for it at this morning:</p>
<p>There is a screenshot describes “The Warden changes the title format, and it is changed to be the initial.”</p>
<p>All work return to the initial again. And I feel myself seems like a joke. Everyone could put forward any requirement to me, but no one cares about my opinion. How could I open my eyes and bear to see something go wrong by some irresponsible decisions? I don’t understand why you hire me to work as a factory worker. I suppose you just need to hire a general front-end developer, which would be enough.</p>
<p>Why do I need to argue with colleagues again and again? What is that I am trying to protect? Whatever how much effort I pay for Kakku, finally I just got a command, and someone told me that is the right way, and I have to do it like that. At the mean time, I have to offend colleagues to fight for a better result.</p>
<p>I work like what environment I described above every day. To me, it is like a war I daily attend. It really makes me disheartened. You don’t know how much effort I spent to try to make the company better. I think you could feel that I had pushed lots of things in Kakku.</p>
<p>To be honest, I feel I cannot revive or change this company. It has too many diseases. No one here wants to make things better, except Justin and Xibo. You won’t know how much obstruction we met in Kakku while we work on KDP. The dictator is still the dictator, the lazy man is still the lazy man, the slippery man is still the slippery man. There is always a question around me and Xibo: For such a small company, why can’t we work to make things right and better together? Every day we live in a war, intrigue each other rather than work together. It’s more like a Chinese Government department.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I could insist until the day I could apply a PR in Kakku. My hope has been run off. The team won’t become better. Instead, I brought much troublesome to this team from I joined. Maybe it’s a wrong choice to join here, for both team and myself.</p>
<p>My girlfriend got a rejection from RMIT University. And she doesn’t want to go to Monash University even though she got its offer. Now she doesn’t have any interest in English learning for IELTS. And she only wants to be a tattooist. We argued nearly a month, which makes me tired.</p>
<p>I am losing the final hope that makes me keeping work in the team. I don’t get a salary could match my ability and my effort, I don’t have authority here, I have to offend colleagues to make things in a right way, I give my girlfriend much pressure, I cannot implement my value here, I cannot learn anything new here. So what is the reason I still keep working hard in the team? Only for the PR? Do I really want to bind myself to it? Every day I ask myself the same questions. You don’t know how depressed I was in every night.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long I could insist here. I have my ideal, but it seems I am losing everything I owned.</p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
