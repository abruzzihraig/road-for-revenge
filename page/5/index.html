            <p>I worked overtime tonight to support those outdated browsers. I made some fallback ways for keeping the effect page flipping consistent among all popular browsers.</p>
<p>From tomorrow, I will apply shadow textures on the effect to make it more natural. Ideally post a demo online before I leave should be a good work to me. Hope everything that I will handle is well. Because I don’t know how much time I have spent for handling those browser compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for my boss to ignore the support of IE8.</p>

            <p>I was shopping a whole day for preparing gifts to my relatives and friends. Since my trunk has enough space so I have to buy something small. Hence the most ideal gift to me is health product.</p>
<p>I went to a pharmacy to buy a case of Swisses products—which is a famous brand around the world and from Melbourne. I studied how to choose a health product online and knew which product could improve the relative symptom. Then I made a Todo list for those health products that will be purchased.</p>
<p>There are still some gifts for my nephews and my girlfriend haven’t been purchased yet. Maybe I will go shopping more times before I leave.</p>
<p>Need to sleep and to meet next Monday.</p>

            <p>I have to recommend you guys the Korean variety show Infinite Challenge again. Tonight, I watched a special edition that pursuit battle which called One Hundred Bald Head. The episode is 347—the Super 7 guys still were there. It has to be the best pursuit battle that I never saw it before.</p>
<p>If you used to see an anime Lire Game by Shinobu Kaitani(one of my favorite cartoonists), you would know the most amazing part in the game is complicated relations among a group of people. Everyone in the group must try their best to protect their interest to get the final victory. So that you can see there are so many activities in human nature, such as betray or ally some people anytime. Hence the story of this kind of game is full of hints and reversals. The show I watched tonight is just like this type of game.</p>
<p>The One Hundred Bald Head is a game that there are seven cases which are locked within one hundred bald heads, and only 2 cases could have three million cash or negative one. The seven MC Members need to find those cases and search some clues for checking if a case has cash or nothing.</p>
<p>Since the game is performed perfectly by those seven MCs, you will laugh and be shocked every minute by their intelligence. It absolutely would change your impression of variety shows.</p>
<p>Just search and enjoy it when you have nothing to do.</p>

            <p>There is only the last week before I leave, so I decide to buy some gifts this weekend for my relatives and friends. But I don’t know which worth to buy as gifts, they are really bothered me. Maybe health products are good choice as they just need a small space in my trunk.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will go shopping these days to see if there is any better choice.</p>

            <p>I don’t know how to help my girlfriend to overcome her poor English. She never listened to me on those essential things which would lead us to a better situation. If she failed on the IELTS test again, she might not be able to come to me.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I persuaded her one year before that she should become to prepare her English for the IELTS test. She always gives me an annoying reason for those insignificant things. I told her do not escape from the hard but essential things. However, she never cared about them until she got failed recently.</p>
<p>These days she stayed at home but didn’t see or listen to anything about English. Just slept more than twelve hours every day but did nothing. And she told me that she has lots of important things need to do every afternoon except her English.</p>
<p>How can I save you, my girlfriend? You always drop out your opportunity to make yourself in crisis. You know you are not a smart girl but why don’t you make an effort for those important things and be responsible for your future life? I am so disappointed when you hung up my call as I criticized you. If you really care about that, why you cannot pass those things? Are they really cannot be touched by your efforts?</p>
<p>I don’t want to lose hope on you again and again and all over again. This is not a difficult thing that to choose and to solve the most critical thing on the way to future. I won’t back to China due to your stupid choice. You can escape from every hard work, but please at least just let me admire you once. I don’t want to live like a loser all the time. I don’t want to see my friend or my girlfriend to be always a loser too. Why cannot just overcome such a simple challenge for the future? I am not your parents who could protect you all the time. If you failed on something, you could return to your family, but I cannot. That’s the most primary difference between we both. If you don’t like that and think the pressure from me is too heavy for you, Just tell me you cannot do that—a English test each student could pass by their efforts.</p>
<p>I could have more than one thousand reasons to come back to China except the one called Poor English. So disappointed I am.</p>

I felt dizzy when I tried to handle different angles with positive or negative quadrants. And the combined Canvases are too complicated when I clip those shapes with different angles as well.</p>

            <p>It’s a normal Sunday. I thought for a long time but still felt there is nothing worth to record today. I slept late yesterday, so I got up almost this afternoon. Read some tutorials of Canvas to think how to make the effect page flipping for ad injection. Then I just cooked for myself—simply fired rice. Finally ended the normal Sunday by watching Infinite Challenge.</p>
<p>Actually, I have much pressure on my work by the last week. I’m not sure if the leader or boss will ask me the process of the effect. I need to get up early tomorrow to make a good impression for those guys.</p>

            <p>I tried to implement an effect that flipping web page from a page corner. It is a requirement by our Ad injection service, and it is designed for switching between the original website and the Ad content more humanized.</p>
<p>In general, it is similar to the effect page flipping when we use some fantastic reading apps such as iBooks. It simulates an exact physical situation when we try to flip a page in a book. I studied the page effect from a blog which written by an experienced graphic developer. He taught us that how to deconstruct the physical effect to a mathematic model, and how to avoid some traps in Canvas on modern browsers.</p>
<p>I don’t have enough experience on Canvas before so that I don’t have the confidence to make everything done on the page flipping effect. I tried to analyze the interaction model to comprehensible conditions to ensure the current technologies could implement the effect on browsers.</p>
<p>I also made some sketches to expound how many difficulties need to be overcome. That is not a simple work for me. I am afraid that my colleagues would complain about it.</p>
<p>No matter how tricky the feature is, at least the first step has been taken.</p>
