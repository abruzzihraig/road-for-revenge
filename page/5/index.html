            <p>My girlfriend persuaded that I should sleep early everyday, because sleeping late will make me unhealthy and depressed. Actually, I think so, but that is a really difficult task for me.</p>
<p>I always procrastinate those important and complex things. For example, wash dishes, write a journal, and take a shower. Once I feel one thing need much time to do, then I get scary, because I don’t want to assign my free time on it. I am just lazy, and I want to get more free time after the busy and tired work.</p>
<p>The bad habit has influenced myself from my childhood. Sometimes I even suppose that’s why I am looked older then others who have same age with me.</p>
<p>If I slept late a whole week, then I will be irritable. After I read some articles about that, I did realise the truth of why I am always angry with some irrelevancies.</p>
<p>So yes, she is right, and I am totally applauding to her. But that is not easy for me, I am a guy who like stay waking up before sleeping, then stay sleeping before waking up. The bad cycle could make me get more time after a few weeks. And I know it also could ruin my health.</p>
<p>If I want to be responsible for my family, my friends, and my girlfriend. I have to change the bad habit from now. I wish my girlfriend could supervise me, if I sleep late again, then I have to buy something as gifts to her.</p>
<p>Hope I could get high-quality sleep everyday.</p>

            <p>I am depressed since I have known there are some unfriendly colleagues want me quit from the company. Even though I did everything best, and I made so much effort for the company, for the clients, and for the boss.</p>
<p>But some guys still dislike me, because my work is actually made them feel to be pushed. They should have written something bad and shitty like before, then get their money from the clients without any effort. But my way is always different with them. So I feel every day they want to kick me out.</p>
<p>I am insecure about the job, and I am so tired and depressed everyday. I am not happy to write more today. Wish tomorrow I could forget something unhappy.</p>

            <p>I’ve preordered a package of PS VR without telling to my girlfriend. Cause she doesn’t allow me to buy it. She always says the first version of VR is immature, we need to wait for the next stable version. But I actually cannot help to play it!</p>
<p>Everyday I imagine what if I could play games with PS VR. Is it immersed? Or it still be immature to make us feel unreal. The only thing I know is the sooner the PS VR is released, the longer I will be kidnapped at home.</p>
<p>Actually, only the PS VR is not enough to play, you still have to buy some other devices or accessories around it. For example, you need to buy a PS4 as the host machine, you need to buy a pair of sticks which called PS Motion for interacting with some special VR games, and you also need to buy a PS camera for detecting your position when you move. Surely, you need a TV as well.</p>
<p>Most of them I already have, and I also have a bunch of games on PS4. That means I just need to wait for 13th Oct, at which the PS VR will be released. A few days after that I will get the rest parts: PS VR and PS Motion.</p>
<p>Wish the day comes soon.</p>

            <p>I have to say the GNU Gettext is the best i18n solution I have never seen before.</p>
<p>Actually, at the end of my last work, my team had already used the Gettext to handle multiple languages then. But I didn’t do anything core about it, so I just remembered that is a kind of multi-language solution.</p>
<p>This week my task is to integrate a i18n solution to our project. Since I have already known the Gettext is the well-known standard, so how can I stand using a silly flow by writing different languages on an Excel?</p>
<p>So that in the afternoon, I tried to add two loaders about Angular Gettext to the Webpack flow we have already used. One loader for extracting language keys from our code, another for compiling language map files into the original code. That is easy to understand the whole cycle.</p>
<p>The files we need to edit are called PO files. Any PO file could be one of languages that used to a project.</p>
<p>And there is another important file named POT. The POT file is a template that created by extracting all of essential key words from the code. Anytime you defined a new word in code need to be translated, the POT file would be updated automatically by the Webpack flow. That’s the loaders’ credit.</p>
<p>The rest thing you need to do is just to update PO file from the template POT, then the PO file will add some new fields could be translated. When you edit the new fields and save it, the Webpack will do us a favour to compile them into our code again. So that you can see the change immediately on a browser.</p>
<p>The whole process is friendly without any pain. There is another incomparable feature is that you even could use a true human translating in the editor Poedit. That means every key word you are translating could be used for fetching a list of translation suggestions from cloud. Even if more suggestions are hidden unless you get a pro version. I think that is enough for translating.</p>
<p>How perfect solution for the multiple languages, I wish anyone who has the same requirements about internationalisation could try it. Then you will be grateful and satisfied.</p>

            <p>It’s to late to write tonight, so I’ll write less in the journal.</p>
<p>Although I’ve made a plan to practise my writing skills by diarising everyday. There is still an issue about speaking. I don’t have any foreign friends here. And that is not a simple thing to make new friends with them. Because I don’t know their culture, I don’t have a good english skill, so they won’t make a friend with me actually.</p>
<p>I was thinking a whole day about how to solve the situation and how to get rid of the bad circulating. It could be made a plan during this week. At least I have some ideas about that.</p>
<p>For instance, I tried to watch dramas frame by frame to figure out any grammar or any words I didn’t know in every sentence. There were so many slangs made me confused. To finish an episode need double time more. I also tried to speak repeatedly with that. It actually made me hurt.</p>
<p>Wish I could find a better way to practise, I am really want to conquer English someday.</p>

            <p>I watched the drama Shameless yesterday until 6 a.m. So I woke up late today.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, there was already two o’clock. And my friend Ryan asked me in Wechat if he could come here to have a discussion with me for his project.</p>
<p>’Oh! Why you didn’t tell me yesterday!’ I replied frighteningly. That means I need to take more than two hours to clean the room before he comes in.</p>
<p>So that I told him he could come to my home after 4 p.m. Then I started to clean immediately.</p>
<p>I washed the toilet with detergent, but the brush has some oil on it. So I had to flush it many times until there is no oil float on water surface.</p>
<p>After that, I folded my bed against the wall. So that there were more space could make a guest feel spacious.</p>
<p>I also used a vacuum cleaner to clean every corner on the floor. Thanks for its battery, it actually could finish the whole cleaning work with me at this important time.</p>
<p>Took shower, washed dishes, Took out the trash, hide clothes and socks. I even don’t have a lunch during the busy cleaning work. I didn’t eat anything nearly one day(so I was very hungry when I discussed with him).</p>
<p>When the work almost finished, he rang the doorbell. What a hurry process! But at least I did it, that was really made me pleasant.</p>

            <p>We front-end team tried to integrate with API service today. But we failed, because there are some mechanisms I was not familiar, especially the authentication and authorisation parts.</p>
<p>We used OAuth 2.0 framework as the authorisation mechanism. That means we front-end team just need keep an access token to fetch any data from our resource server. I never used the OAuth before, even though I’ve known that is popular in everywhere.</p>
<p>I thought it should be easy, so I tried to analyse code from previous projects. I knew if we use OAuth, we have to write code according to a right format, but I didn’t know what is the actual interaction between an App and an Auth Server.</p>
<p>Nothing broke my mind when I was thinking how the authorisation is handled between an App and a server. I even found a perfect logic to explain how it works, and I also told that for my team member. Another backend colleague agreed with me as well.</p>
<p>However, I paid one hour to read the RFC document of OAuth 2.0 in the evening. Then I found I was totally wrong. Every parts I reasoned is incorrect. I made so many jokes on it. That made me really shamed.</p>
<p>I should have read the RFC document before I taught others. It just needs one hour to read the basic usage and the whole authentication architecture. Then I will get a right way to understand something under the hood.</p>
<p>Hope next time I do not make the same mistake for others.</p>

            <p>Today is an actual festival for family reunion. But my girlfriend felt depressed. Her father was reviewed by a doctor, and the doctor said that he needs to make a surgery for a tumour on his skin.</p>
<p>Actually, he did the same surgery 2 years ago, but recently he was reviewed that the tumour is relapsed again. The doctor advised him to do the same surgery again.</p>
<p>So that my girlfriend is worried about him. Because the tumour is under his ear. That means if the tumour needs to be cut, his ear has to be peeled first. It will make a severe pain to himself.</p>
<p>Another thing made her anxious is that if the tumour relapsed again and again, who can make sure the disease would be cured indeed? It should have a nice festival today, However,  her family were falling into the nervous for the father’s tumour. I companied with her searched some information about her father’s disease, but we find more, we worry more.</p>
<p>Hope everything would be fine, and hope her father could make the surgery as soon as possible. Learn the condition of her father from doctors is better than search online.</p>
<p>That also reminds me to face the health problem. I need to be more healthier to prevent someday when I am old but with some diseases. I don’t want anyone especially my family or my friends worry about my body.</p>

            <p>It is a special day. My friend Ryan invited me to his home to have dinner. Since the mid-autumn festival is approaching, so he think we should play together to celebrate it.</p>
<p>Ryan is actually an incredible chef, he even wanted to make some moon cakes! But it is regrettable because the flour cannot stick with water and butter. So the moon cakes were failed.</p>
<p>Although we didn’t eat the moon cake, but Ryan still made some other dishes. Those food are pretty delicious, lamb ribs, bamboo shoot and saliva chicken were all eaten up by us. I even thought it is wasting his talent to be a developer, he should have been a chef.</p>
<p>After dinner, we played a board game German Heart Disease. This game needs a high attention to watch if the cards are valid on the board. If they are valid, we need grab to touch the bell as soon as possible, then the winner will get more cards, until all of cards are occupied by the winner.</p>
<p>The game made me nervous, and it is not easy to play. After that I nearly felt tired. I have to say I am not good at this kind of board game, maybe girls more like that.</p>
<p>This is my first mid-autumn festival out of China, but it still made me warm and happy. Thanks for Ryan and Yifei.</p>
