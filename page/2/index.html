            <p>As what I expected yesterday, the warden brought a heap of unreasonable ideas to us. He tried to force us to follow everything from his mind, but only one thing you could get from him is that you cannot imagine how arrogant a man could be.</p>
<p>We three Chinese guys argued with him a whole afternoon. Even though he didn’t have any valuable argument, he still wasted our time by his quibble.</p>
<p>He wants to split we front-end guys to different projects—as he just wants to make every project has a person who is totally responsible for the project itself. So that if our boss asks us a specific problem on any projects, then the warden can just easy to put the issue to someone.</p>
<p>That means if there is an issue, someone must be guilty.</p>
<p>That also means we cannot do the part of what we are good at in a project. Each front-end developer must implement all features throughout a whole project, whatever the build workflow, library choose, code style, basic structure, fancy component, you name it. It is absolutely ineffective for us—only two front-end developers—and one is a newbie.</p>
<p>If there is a project which is totally written by one person that might work with his silly idea. But all projects in our company are written by a team. How could make one person totally understand every detail in the project by others? That is impossible. What if one developer has to maintain and change some code on the work by others? He/She may be able to implement the changes, but there might be side effects around there as well. Someday when the original code author found the reason of the side effects, the author may have to rewrite the code which changed by the previous maintainer.</p>
<p>Such an ineffective strategy. You cannot believe that it comes from a man who called himself a software architect. Doesn’t he feel shameful? This is a small company which only have five developers in it. If I have to work with somebody like him, I’d rather drink poison. But I don’t have any choice due to I am still in the jail.</p>
<p>I cannot get the personality which is arrogant and ignorant from some nations, but wish I can get rid of those nations in my future work.</p>
<p>Another thing is if we split our front-end team, which indicates one developer could do everything from top to bottom. That also means I could be fired painless anytime by the warden when he feels unhappy with me.</p>
<p>That’s it, the new life in jail has come again.</p>

            <p>Will tears as the lead is going to back office tomorrow. I will remember those two happy weeks forever when he didn’t stay in the office. Thank God gave me those days without him so that I could fish in troubled water and keep relaxing.</p>
<p>For celebrating that we Chinese guys got rid of the lead’s control, or maybe I should say the warden’s control, we took more than two hours to have a sumptuous lunch—the best Korean fried chicken in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the next two weeks I will be fine in work, but the good news is Christmas day is coming, and they all will have an extended leave so that maybe I don’t have something annoying need to do. But that’s just my optimistic hope.</p>
<p>No matter what will come after he backs, I will try my best to live in the jail.</p>

<p>But sorry guys, there is no time to write again. I promise that tomorrow I will write a journal once I got home.</p>

<p>As a free purchasing broker, my dear sister commanded that I need to buy a variety of stuff for her little baby. It was so hot, and the purchase list is so long. I felt shameful when I looted all of goods and suffered despising from surrounding customers. So I told her I won’t help her to buy anything for her friends. Hope she could be considerate to me.</p>

            <p>Our tester came up with an unreasonable requirement when she tested our work. She thinks as a user she expects that the size of drag&amp;drop zone should be changed by a specific image size. What a silly thought I cannot believe it was put forward by our ‘professional’ tester. So I wrote an email to try to explain why it is an unreasonable requirement and why we should not implement it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For drag&amp;drop zone. I think we don’t need to make its shape related to a particular image size, which is unreasonable in component architecture. Before we reflect on whether a feature or an improvement will look better, we should think if it is reasonable first.<br>&nbsp;<br>At this scenario, the drag&amp;drop zone as a better uploading component will improve the user experience. But it is basically an uploading component first. We should keep every component as possible as pure so that we could easily to maintain and reuse them in the future. That means the business logic should not pollute those components which have a single purpose, such as the uploading component.<br>&nbsp;<br>The shape of drag&amp;drop zone is designed for helping user drag and drop their files handily. That’s why the zone is big enough. If the size of the zone depends on a particular image size, it will bring us more issues on the stability of the project. For example, drag&amp;drop doesn’t know what the size it will accept from users’ choice. If the size is small, it will make user inconvenient to drop the files. If the size is too large(I noticed there would be images has the size of 800x160), keep the same behavior will be unexpected and unreasonable in design. That’s why we shouldn’t implement the ‘improvement.’ Because If the further image size is accepted, then the rule of this improvement will be totally failed. And users may also feel confused with its changeful size.<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why I don’t think it’s a tradeoff or an improvement on user experience. Before we analyze the look and feel of a requirement from user’s perspective, we should think about if it is reasonable first. The user finally will understand why we did like those rather than totally matched their thoughts at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I received the reply like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand. Thank you for your explanation.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would still like to run this by Kaveh/Yee at a later time as a design consideration for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I talked with a duck? Why I need to take so much effort to try to persuade someone who doesn’t care about my serious thought. Am I only a worker who always listens to the orders from others even the orders are incredibly foolish?</p>
<p>Only God knows what I am doing in this babyish but infighting company. And only one thing I can do is continue to stay in jail.</p>

            <p>Don’t know why my right knee was twisted yesterday. It’s painful, and I cannot easy to go upstairs. I got the similar accident more than three times in the past year. I’m not sure if I have a problem with my knees. I should check it when I return to Beijing.</p>
<p>My father in law made a surgery these days, to cut a melanoma in his external auditory meatus. The surgical result is good, and the wound is small. For now, he is still lying on hospital bed, and there are some relatives nearby to accompany him. My girlfriend also visits him every day. Hope he could get well as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The disease is the worst thing during our life. To prevent if someday we got a critical illness, we’d better do exercise more frequently and do physical examination every year. Otherwise, no life to play will be the most woeful thing.</p>

            <p>Just argued with my girlfriend two hours. She failed with her University applying. We felt so regretful on that. But she said many times to me that she want to be a tattooist. I said to her: ‘yes, you can do that, if you want to lose me.’</p>
<p>Fuck for those whimsical dreams when we need to be responsible for our future life in this cruel society.</p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
