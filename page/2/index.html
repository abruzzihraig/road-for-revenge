            <p>Today I finally got the desk which I had bought nearly 3 weeks ago. From store! not online.</p>
<p>Can’t believe that everything easy in Beijing but difficult in Melbourne. Especially online shopping and network applying. Those both were hit me deeply here.</p>
<p>Even if I have so many words to complain on network applying, but for the moment, I just want to focus on the online shopping. Describing to you an inefficient flow on online shopping in Australia.</p>
<p>I went to the furniture mall Domayne on 16 of July, with my girlfriend. Fortunately we found a desk has a good price after through a group of expensive woods. Due to my room space is so narrow, I had to back to home to measure if it is acceptable for a new desk.</p>
<p>The next day I decided to buy the desk, so we went to Domayne again. After some conversation I finally paid it. But the elder clerk who was handled my information form, he said the desk is out stock, so they have to pick a new one from their warehouse. ‘Next week, Monday or Tuesday I will call you then you need to come here to pick it up’ the elder said.</p>
<p>Fine, I was waiting.</p>
<p>Monday passed, no one called me.</p>
<p>Tuesday passed, no one called me.</p>
<p>Again, On the Wednesday, I returned to Domayne third time to ask why they didn’t call me. A staff told me the desk has came to the store, I can pick it up then. However, the staff led us to find the desk, but there was no one belonged to us, cause they made a mistake that they picked a wrong type of desk.</p>
<p>So I had to return to home then wait a new one transferring.</p>
<p>After 3 days or so, they gave me a call for notifying me that a new one had been transferred to their store,  would if I want it be delivered to my home freely. Surely I said yes, because the desk is so heavy, if they could deliver it freely, I will absolutely use the service.</p>
<p>Then, I waited 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Even though the distance between the store Domayne to my apartment just about 1 kilometre, it still took 2 weeks to delivery.</p>
<p>And it also took me nearly 3 hours to assemble it, after doing that, I felt I am older then before.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I had bought a Dell monitor P2715Q at the same time from <a href="https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/dell-p-series-27-p2715q-led-monitor-dell/" target="_blank" rel="external">kogan.com</a>. But I am still waiting for it. And Kogan had offered me a $50 git card for their delay.</p>
<p>So missing Beijing, so missing IKEA. Just sharing my tears.</p>

            <p>There is always sometime you feel the inspiration dried up. I feel so today.</p>
<p>When the time close to evening, I found a significant article from my subscription of HackerNews. That is <a href="http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">How to read a book</a>. This article has so much attention from community thus it has been third recommendation on the subscription list today. That actually made me felt a little bit astonished: why the article which just like teaching material from any primary school could be in top 3 of HackNews notification?</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I guess most of hackers are more care about how to learn rather than what should be learned. They may focus on a high-level process that is learning way itself.</p>
<p>No matter what they think, I don’t have any motivation from it. Everyone knows I am learning English without a way to exam, I don’t want to read something only focus on how to quickly answer a few questions after it ends. So yes that made me interested.</p>
<p>I read the half article. It indicates a clear argument: your time is limited in the real world, you need to control your reading strategy and time to make you get high information more effectively.</p>
<p>And It is indeed has some meaningful viewpoints that I have never seen before. The most fascinating part I was learned is that you should figure out the background of the author whose books you are going to read on. In that way you can analyse which part of his/her books is intellectual context. Reading book dialectically then you won’t following all of arguments from an author, so you can prevent some of meaningless parts with prejudices, blind spots, desperate moments or desires from their books.</p>
<p>Good night with the best soft drink in Australia:<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abruzzihraig/road-for-revenge/master/assets/images/bundaberg.jpg" alt="BUNDABERG" title="BUNDABERG"></p>

            <p>It’s too late today, so I have to write less then before.</p>
<p>Yesterday I’ve written that I don’t want to write a journal as a boring flow. So yes I have some new ideas today. That is, focus on one or two points each journal to make them meaningful.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I tried to find some books which could teach people who don’t have any English writing experience or relative culture just like me. The book should focus on how to write rather than just grammar. Through a series of researches, finally, I decided to read the book ‘On Writing Well’ first.</p>
<p>I started to read the book ’On writing Well’ tonight, even if reading it is slower than Chinese book. I just read a few pages on the first chapter, but it still aroused my sympathy.</p>
<p>The significant part I excerpt below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That condition was first revealed in the 1980s, when people<br>began writing on word processors. Two opposite things happened.<br>The word processor made good writers better and bad<br>writers worse. Good writers know that very few sentences come<br>out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time.<br>For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to<br>fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and<br>reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. Bad writers<br>became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy<br>and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen. How could<br>such beautiful sentences not be perfect?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That condition made me surprised, because It almost same as occurring on the careers software engineer or designer. Maybe they are all belong to a career which creates craft.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many software developers after I graduated from school. And I realised there are two opposite ways they are walking on, just like the different writers above. Some developers improve their skills everyday, using much time to think how they could make business logic simpler, how they could make code more maintainable and clear, how to use a better way to balance aesthetics and performance and, how to use advanced parts on programming languages.</p>
<p>As for other developers who just walking on the opposite way, copying verbose code everyday. They often import so many libraries with different qualities to project, then use those APIs with smatter to make the project finally comes apart like a shit.</p>
<p>If we want something tasteful, we want something beautiful and meaningful, why wouldn’t we choose the right way to create our crafts? Also that is why I should choose a better way to write.</p>

            <p>Can’t believe that so many friends had noticed what I have done. Why you can find me? Does the timeline of yours is static?</p>
<p>Fine, never mind. I’ve got change something for the speeding that has been loosing control. But you, my friends, you can still easy to figure out what I am thinking if you are really interesting. After all you are always smarter then me.</p>
<p>It’s a time to record something, although I don’t want any words from my hand such like boring flow. But sorry, it is English, I need more time to learn how to control detailed grammar so as to assembly architecture of article.</p>
<p>Feeling helpless is an indescribable status that always around myself. Sometime it through my body to heart, made me depressed. Everyone asked me why you often seem unhappy and gloomy. Come on guys, there is always a person you have ever seen. Accept me with a little bit different, I’m just a guy who had through so many tragedies.</p>
<p>Today I won’t abuse someone, I don’t want to say fuck you every night in my dream. Actually I fight the man a few times in nightmare.</p>
<p>I’ve been here less than 3 months. So many unknown and funny things came along with me. Everyday I was involved to status ignorant. ‘Anyone who can help me’ I asked for myself on my brain. I’ve got have friends here, that is the most important thing then any other one.</p>
<p>You know I just like a man who from cartoon Polish Man. I don’t like talk with people especially those I did not know. So embarrassing it is! But I need friends here to live, so I bit the bullet to attend technical Meetup. Of course, Chinese guys. Astonishing, so bad I can’t believe they could find a job here. I guessed some of them would earn more then mine.</p>
<p>The meetup is so low-quality, so I don’t want to attend it again. Fortunately I still got 3 guys here. There is only one guy looked has good knowledge as a devops engineer. He just left from Netease then get here recently. The other two guys has a same age with me as graduating from Monash University. Anyway, I got 3 guys as friends here, in addition to the Chinese colleague nearby me.</p>
<p>Those friends helped me fixing so many issues on life. They are all kind person. But there still has something made me felt sad. That is, I noted those guys who has a same age with me always through wrong way on technic and profession, just like I used to be 3 years ago.</p>
<p>No matter what I suppose how should they solve the high-level problems first to prevent falling into traps. Nobody really could feel the source of problems. Continues with tired and unprofessional status, can not get a good job and, do not know what is a valuable part they should invest on profession. With the kindness on work, receive each of unreasonable requirement, then make themselves into the traps. So sad so helpless, can’t break the paper box with the soft body:</p>
<p>Just like a pizza.</p>
