            <p>I worked overtime tonight. For complaining, I sent a long email to my boss so that I don’t want to practice writing more today. The email will be displayed by the following portion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When can we rewrite the whole ks injection and the project venue portal? You don’t actually know how bad these projects are. Every day we spent a few hours to find where a stupid bug comes from, then tried to fix it just by one or two line code. But found the stupid reason may take us 3 hours.<br>&nbsp;<br>If we fixed a bug, the fixed code might cause other side effects, then someday the new issues come again on JIRA. I don’t want to waste our precious dev resources and time on such silly and unmaintainable projects more. I can promise even though we modify these existing code two years; the project won’t be good as KDP. You shouldn’t use me on such work that everyone can do it. And I actually cannot rescue the legacy code, the authors of Ks injection and venue portal are not real engineers.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, I might pay at least one week to fix some silly issues on video insertion, and every time I fix one, the another issue comes. But I tried to rewrite the video insertion yesterday. You may not believe I just used 4 hours but implemented the same basic functionalities and effects as before. I’m totally confused why they could write code more than 2000 lines to implement such simple feature. They did those projects with the lowest related knowledge. You even can feel every part in those projects are full of the flavor from some developer question websites.<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe our backend projects are bad too. Everything about deploying and testing and debugging in our team is totally amateur. You cannot believe how stupid we are when debugging an issue in production online, just like debugging CPU. Do you believe I can finish both of front-end and backend of KS injection only 3 months? Do you really think the injection is difficult like what you guys thought? If I got any my best backend friend in China, I think we two guys can finish all work from Kakku set up only one year, and with high quality and maintainability.<br>&nbsp;<br>So don’t be blind, there is no one can be called architect in this company. I don’t think some people here can pass the basic tech interview. If you really care about the company, you should think about why we always produce the low-quality products with a bunch of issues/bugs, and also why we paid so much time on those shitty work.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don’t want to see the same situation this year–we waste time on those bugs of the poor projects again and again.Then when close to the end of the year, there will be a voice urge us that we don’t have time to make projects better or we don’t have time to rewrite or we don’t have time for anything except someone’s bad decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you still don’t care about the current low-efficiency status on everybody, and if you still think the dev team works normally as you expect. Trust me, someday the good guys will leave, and the bad guys will eat the company up.</p>

<p>Have a good night! Our leader will bring the new tasks tomorrow from his brilliant brain.</p>

            <p>Tonight is too hot. I cannot focus on anything I wanted to do. The only one thing I did meaningful tonight is that only use less than 20-line code instead of the 2000-line legacy code implemented a live demo for our primary product. I don’t know why these guys wrote so much useless code to implement such a small requirement, plus the 3rd-party libraries, and their legacy code is more than six thousand lines. I believe they had already taken at least three months on it, but why our boss thought that makes sense? It’s funny story, about how to fish in troubled water.</p>

            <p>It’s a relaxing holiday Labour’s day. I implemented a part of my daily plan. But one thing I noticed made me feeling good, which is my girlfriend was learning something about how to love from books.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I have some faults on how I express love to my partner. However, I never tried to figure out those problems. Even though sometimes I think I am using a rational way to analyze any issues between us, I did not really care about how did she think. I predicate that she could learn how to solve those problems between us. That’s the only way to reduce arguments and keep harmony.</p>
<p>Love needs to be learned. If someday I have free time, I wish I could learn the same knowledge from that too.</p>

            <p>I found a weird phenomenon when I looked through the app Zhihu. Along with a community grows, the member quality would be shitty. From v2ex, Zhihu, Bilibili to Github, each of them used to be a minority community with a group of elites. But recently I have seen many ignorant words on these platforms. I cannot express how these guys could be such arrogant and pompous as if they just want to brag online as they did nothing in their real life.</p>
<p>I hate these stupid Chinese guys who always ruin every community and make them be another Baidu forum. How could we ignore these guys? Can we use a kind of blacklist plugin to ban them? Especially whoever likes bragging and cheating with their ignorance and arrogance.</p>
<p>They are absolutely making everything worse.</p>

            <p>I made an effort tonight on writing how to understand the git merge and git rebase. The Rebase has a deep pitfall in itself. If you want to use it without pain, you have to make sure you had known everything about that before. Figuring out its essence took me so much time until 2 a.m. And that’s why I didn’t finish other tasks and why I won’t write more today.</p>
<p>I hope my effort could help whoever met the same issue before.</p>

<p>A fancy matter is that I cooked a vegetable soup by myself tonight. With pepper it tasted so yummy. For sleep early tonight, I have to stop writing and go to practice my English speaking. After all, that’s the most important plan among all of my decisions.</p>

            <p>I read an article from my ex-boss, the article which is posted today and is shared by all his employers. I have to say I don’t need to flatter him but he is actually a wise man. You can learn a lot from his words.</p>
<p>From the article he posted today, you could learn how a company overcomes the winter. I also looked through his articles from history, and I found something interesting about professionalism. He said that being professional will help you be confident about everything you will meet. Then you don’t need to care whatever petal small profit. You will get a large world.</p>
<p>I think so. I met so many people who think they got a necked bottle in their profession, and they were thinking about whether they need to turn to another industry. I said no, I don’t think they really got the neck bottle if they had tried their best to be professionals. For example, if you are an engineer, are you really good at English? Do you really care about something under the hood? Do you subscribe and read the news in your domain every day? Have you really paid attention to whatever you used in your project? Even the tools or editor you used? If not, you just never wanted to be a professional. That’s why you always thinks that you feel boring on your work.</p>
<p>Even to be a cleaner, you still have lots of things to think and to learn. You could pay your whole life on how to improve your professionalism. That’s the only way to happy in your work.</p>

            <p>I did practice on daily English speaking just now. There is a question to describe hometown or any other cities I used to live. So I brought the question to here to try to find out more differences among wherever I lived.</p>
<p>I’ve been living in my hometown for about eighteen years. It’s a tiny city, and it’s near huge mountains, so the surrounding areas are quite beautiful. However, the city hasn’t changed much in the last twenty years. That’s because there were so many safety issues around. The city named Yining, and it is made up by a dozen of different nations. Some of the nations there are more like East European so that the different cultures might cause some conflicts. So we went through a series of terrorist attacks during this twenty years. It prevented economy and development for a long period.</p>
<p>After I had gone to study in college, I lived in Beijing for about six years. Beijing is a great bustling city, even though sometimes it has an air issue. The city is 24-hour so that you can find any service conveniently. But I finally choose to leave there, because it is exhausting to live, you have to think about how to earn much every day. The traffic issue also hit me. I even need to spend more than three hours per day on the road to work.</p>
<p>Now I am living in Melbourne. It is a quite sleepy city. It hasn’t much nightlife like Beijing. You can find everywhere is natural and peaceful. Whereas the cost of living here is really high, it’s expensive than it used to be. I am trying to learn more about this city until l can get another opportunity to elsewhere.</p>
