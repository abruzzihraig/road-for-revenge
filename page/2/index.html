            <p>It is another ineffective workday. The only one voice in my head persuaded me do not be angry at the words from someone who is extremely amateur. Even though he expressed like there was a discussion among the whole team, we all know that was just a show by himself. The decision had been made by him before the discussion began.</p>
<p>I have been programming four years more, but I never saw amateur stuff like they did. It seems like we three Chinese guys are always company a rude baby to create some kinds of shitty toys.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why he insisted on keeping two API calls for rendering a list in front-end. We just want to use one call for fetching a list of data to render the Advertisement list. They said some parts of data they have to fetch from another service. That’s why we have to make multiple calls to get the data. Why can’t they choose a cache server to fetch the 3rd-party service automatically? No one knows why. Maybe they know nothing.</p>
<p>Even though our Chinese backend guy gave him many recommendations to make the shitty works one call. But he still tried to find some stupid and weird reasons to reject the significant advice.</p>
<p>I think business in architecture should be layered. Each part of them has a proper position. For this evil decision, it is totally an excuse for making someone keep lazy and relaxing. They just want to put the messy business logic to front-end. Front-end is just a layer view, why it should handle the messy business logic which should have written in the backend? The only answer to me might be they know nothing about how to be a professional programmer and what should they do with a right way in software engineering.</p>
<p>God is blessing them that they are working in an incredibly lazy country. If any of them tries to find a good job in China, they will be rejected a thousand of times.</p>
<p>They pay me money anyway, how can I fight for myself to refuse the silly amateur solution? I’m just fucked and kept the fucking happy mood every day.</p>

            <p>I’ve already tried to learn something about Sketch. I read some articles tonight, but I am still confused with each corner on the panel of Sketch. I even feel it only works for smartphones or tablets. There is few resource about web design on Sketch tutorials.</p>
<p>Even though I had nothing improved on my path to learning design, I got some shocking views about Chinese girls on a business called overseas purchasing. It was an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>My nephew was born five months ago, so my sister wants me to buy some milk powder and baby food for her son. Everyone in China knows that milk powder in there is unsafe because too many businesses in China are totally conscienceless. And Australia is one of a major exporter of agriculture. So the milk powder in Australia is attractive to Chinese.</p>
<p>You can’t believe every corner of this city must have a Chinese delivery store. One box can be filled with three cans of milk powder. That is an unspoken rule for each Chinese student here. Especially a bunch of girls. No one knows how much tax they have evaded. According to an investigation by the government, the estimated value is one hundred million per year.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter to me I thought then. I just wanted to buy a few cans of milk powder, a few bottles of Calcium, and a few bags of baby rice.</p>
<p>However, I was utterly failed. I figured out nothing except two bottles of fish oil in the two of largest chemist’s shops here. All of what I wanted to buy were out of stock. The only valuable stuff on the empty shelf was its price tag. How can I get them from the Chinese hands?</p>
<p>Yes, the answer is to buy them from a Chinese shop.</p>
<p>Finally, I got everything from a Chinese overseas purchasing store. And they even provide a service to deliver the packages to China. They got the victory, but I got the sweat.</p>
<p>What the fuck today, it took me nearly three hours to search that essential stuff of life, then the result is I have to pay the money back to Chinese. Holy ironic.</p>

            <p>To be an artist is my dream all the time. I never changed my primal interests during these years in a cruel society, although I have to earn money from some shitty works for life.</p>
<p>I love music; I love writing, and I surely love the design as well. That’s why I decided to be a front-end programmer when I was learning software engineering in university. I never thought someday the career will be hot, and the related practitioners will be understaffed. So that It even makes it possible I could live in another country at the moment. Rather than most of the recent front-end guys who just learned from some amateur training courses a few months then try to find a job with high salary.</p>
<p>I chose to be a front-end guy just because I love the work to show my crafts to others. I like exquisite and high-quality stuff with a rich sense of design. To implement the GUI artworks could satisfy me deeply. That’s why I found a way different to others when my university didn’t have the related courses.</p>
<p>This year, I don’t know if I am lazy or I am becoming more and more conservative. I even feel boring sometimes when there are a bunch of similar libraries newborn but have same principles with before. It is more like a victory of sales rather than to make artworks better. I cannot pay them my passion on, to catch up the new wine in an old bottle made me tired and unhappy.</p>
<p>These days I gradually to find some articles about UI design, some artworks shocked me. I can’t help sharing them with my girlfriend. I try to analyze some details to her to show how the design is excellent in my opinion. Since I don’t have professional knowledge on design, so I always think I don’t have confidence on my comments. Because I am a programmer, I know every career has a huge mountain behind. You can’t just think about them above the surface then give somebody comments irresponsibly.</p>
<p>So I asked my girl if I am so happy with design rather than tired to catch the dull and similar techniques on front-end, why can’t I try to learn something about design? At least, it should be better than playing games every weekend to me. We all supposed that I should learn design and do some artworks by myself. Even though the artworks could be shit, it will make my step to interest closer at least.</p>

            <p>There is a bad news that the PS VR I’ve already preordered has been delayed to deliver, and the estimated date of shipment is due in Dec 2016. Please be happy with my sorrow.</p>
<p>Since Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in literature yesterday, I am curious about how excellent writing does he have. I cannot actually understand the poems from his lyrics and his duck-like voice. Even though I heard his songs from junior high school, and I also know lots of his stories. So I decided to find a biography of himself.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called Bob Dylan Chronicles, it describes his legendary life during the luminous period when he made folk music revive in America. He was indeed a talent in that era. I suppose I could feel a few elegant sentences in his writing, it is easygoing rather than obscure.</p>
<p>When he described an environment, he wrote a paragraph like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out side the wind was blowing, straggling cloud wisps, snow whirling in the red lanterned streets, city types scuffling around, bundled up — salesmen in rabbit fur earmuffs hawking gimmicks, chestnut vendors, steam rising out of manholes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a picture of the sense around you when you read the paragraph, isn’t it? It just like yo u lived with him in the story.</p>
<p>However, when he wrote about himself, it comes with below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I was playing at the time were hard-lipped folk songs with fire and brimstone servings, and you didn’t need to take polls to know that they didn’t match up with anything on the radio, didn’t lend themselves to commercialism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could find a little ridicule on his words, the sentences are concise with a little sharp.</p>
<p>Since my reading speed is still slow, so I just read a few pages on the sample of the book. I wish I could read more if I have time. Because he is a hero and a true star to me, I am interested to learn more from his writing to know what did he think in his legendary past.</p>

            <p>Since daylight saving has become, the sunset is getting more late everyday. After one hour overtime, there was still light outside. So I decided to buy some food from market.</p>
<p>There was a little wind with warm sunshine. I walked relaxedly and a few songs of Coldplay were around my head. I can’t help to take a breath then, everything on the road was fresh to me.</p>
<p>I became to think what is my final destination. Beijing? Melbourne? Sydney or a city in US? I don’t know if every step is safe to my future. But I indeed enjoyed the moment I can feel everything comfortable within the beautiful city.</p>
<p>That might be a dreaming island parts of you want to be in, isn’t it? So I should be satisfied even though there are some shitty work are waiting for me all the time. I am a fortunate guy, I have such an opportunity to break out GFW to live in a free and clean island. It should have been a pleasant experience. I need to stop complaining more and to enjoy the truly free time.</p>

            <p>Let me pray for my boss first. He is such a generous guy! He approved me to exchange my overtime to a few days off. I’ve worked more than 43 hours overtime this month. That means I could get more than one month vocation with the rest of my annual leave. The Chinese New Year is waving its hands for me.</p>
<p>I don’t know why it is hard for me to speak English smoothly just like Chinese. There are always something break me in, even though I know how to speak and how to organise a sentence to make sense. But once I open my month, my tough will be frozen suddenly. I cannot speak even a simple word sometimes. That’s actually make me depressed.</p>
<p>I know I have a little bit stammer. But when I use Chinese, I could choose another synonyms quickly if I feel my tough is blocked by a word. So there were little people know I have a slight stammer. But when the situation is changed to English environment. I am totally failed. I guess I could be known as a stupid in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>But how can I get rid of the nightmare? It is hard for me and it is extremely unstable. Sometimes I could speak anything smoothly from my mind. But sometimes I could feel there is an old witch is using a toilet plunger stab into my mouth. I really want to explain to the guys who I was talking to. The frozen time during a talk is always make me embarrassed.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a good idea? I really hope there are some useful recommendations and experience for me.</p>

            <p>My girlfriend showed me a short video about a girl had a cancer. I don’t know where does she get it, but she said it is touching and it nearly made her cry. So she asked me that I have to watch it immediately.</p>
<p>The video only has 10 minutes. It is a TV show about performing a perfect speech. But it’s not like the TED.</p>
<p>The speaker is a women as one of successful people. She got a cancer on her ovary this year. She is still single, that means she will lose a possibility to be a mother if she need to cut her ovary. Even though she might fortunately keep her life after a series of surgeries.</p>
<p>She reviewed and reflected her past during these years. She was too busy to sleep early everyday(That’s why my girlfriend asked me to watch it). She could have done more examinations when her doctor told her there were something abnormal in her body. But she ignored the warning then worked harder than before.</p>
<p>After she passed out at home. A doctor said her tumor in her ovary is too large now. No one knew if it is a vicious tumor. So she had to wait for a surgery to judge.</p>
<p>She nearly broke down. Cause all of efforts for she wanted to seek a better life will be totally ruined by the simple word cancer. She got the cancer even though she exercises regularly all the time.</p>
<p>Her friends and her family around her are sad everyday. They all felt that is unfair and cruel to her. But they also knew it is to late. She was so regretful to work hard before, the hard work made her stay up late every day.</p>
<p>Finally, she wanted every one who was listening to her to remember nothing is important but health.</p>
<p>The story is ended, but my life is continued. Then the next limitation from my girlfriend to me is that I cannot sleep late anymore. Guys, please share my tears.</p>

            <p>I should have recorded something about new technologies or experiences on learning English.  Before I live here, I even thought I will have enough time to learn Haskell or to build an open-source project. But how ashamed I am, I can’t help to tell you guys the game Bloodbourne is holly incredible! I have never seen a better one before. Of course, excepting the Dark Souls 3.</p>
<p>Bloodbourne is just like the game Dark Souls 3. They all designed by the genius guy Hidetaka Miyazaki. The game has a similar art style with Dark Souls series. They are black, repressed, gothic and have an aesthetic violence. There is little word you can get from NPCs during the whole game, but you could reason each clue from the descriptions of props you got from the game. It’s obscure but it has more different understandings among all of the gamers.</p>
<p>It is an extremely difficult game as well, just like Dark Souls. But I cannot say which one is more difficult, cause they have different points on the difficulty. For example, in the Dark Souls 3, you could hold a shield to prevent damage on yourself, but there is no shield in Bloodbourne. However, you have more solutions and a faster speed of injection to revive your life in Bloodbourne. So you cannot simply judge which one is more difficult. But if you are a newbie, no matter which one you want to play, I suppose you will die a thousand of times before you become an expert.</p>
<p>Even though I know I am so decadent during the several months, but I have to say the game Bloodbourne is an extremely attractive game you shouldn’t miss that.</p>

            <p>There was an idea broke out when I was taking shower tonight. That is maybe classifying everyone is essential in the society.</p>
<p>We used to hear that some people said do not classify anyone, because everyone is unique. I thought so before. Yes, everyone is unique for themselves, because no one wants itself normal like any other people. But, to the society, it does’t care about if anyone is unique. That’s a one of rules of the true world.</p>
<p>When I played my guitar and I wanted to find a way to perform music, there were so many music lovers looked same. They have similar taste on every bad thing. I cannot accept that to make myself just like them without human thinking. Most of features on the class were opposite to my belief.</p>
<p>After I became a programmer, I found my friends have same interests and habits. To catch them sometimes are made me tired and boring . For example, they like Japanese anime, they like playing individual games. If any one of them find a new interest thing, the rest of them almost are interested with that. I don’t know why they are always same and happy with that. To me, it feels like I am not in their class.</p>
<p>That made me remind an interesting thing. In the game Dark Souls 3, you can choose a kind of profession as a initialisation. There are multiple types could be chosen, a fighter, an enchanter, an assassin, or something else. There is only one profession specific is called useless man, he has average properties when initialise. Actually during the whole game, if you want to avoid being killed by enemies, you have to contribute yourself as a specific way to be an expert. If you grow averagely, or just grow with your interests, you cannot easy to live in the game world.</p>
<p>It just likes the true society. If you don’t contribute yourself as a specific type, you will be normal and hard to live with the true enemies within the same world.</p>
