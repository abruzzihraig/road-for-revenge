            <p>It’s just a gaming day, and nothing needs to record as before. I played the Dark Souls 3 a whole night with my friend Chong. We got through a maze and tried to fight with multiple intruders, but we all died.</p>
<p>I started to search some compelling dramas again due to the boring weekend. I should have been going to barbecue with my friends tomorrow, but since they invited so many new guys that I didn’t familiar, so I declined them politely. Maybe we could have a board game when we don’t need to invite so many people.  After all, the scenario of many people always makes me feel awkward.</p>
<p>Give tomorrow another relaxing expectation, and hope the time flows slowly.</p>

            <p>Watched some TV shows, played the latest game Dishonored 2. I‘ve been relaxing at the whole night. But I don’t have anything want to write today.</p>
<p>The Dishonored2 is not excellent like what I expected before. I even cannot stay interested in it more than one hour. I suppose maybe I don’t belong to the gamers who like to play as a spy or an assassin. Maybe the DarkSouls3 and the Bloodborne raised my taste on those ACT/RPG games. I don’t have any interest in a simple game which doesn’t have any punishment when you fail or die.</p>
<p>No matter what I am going to enjoy the weekend. I could sleep until tomorrow afternoon.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I wrote a piece of email to my boss to answer his question about a bug. Since I was earnest about it, so I just want to migrate it to my today’s diary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Yee,</p>
<p>This afternoon I tried to use English to explain why the video injection doesn’t show on some websites. And I know you are totally confused with my poor English spoken, I feel so sorry, and that makes me feel uncomfortable. Even though it is hard to explain even use Chinese, I still want to explain it again to you, and it is also a practice to me that using English to answer a complicated question.</p>
<p>During 2013 - 2015, most of the popular front-end technical architectures are based on ‘Multiple Pages Website.’ It is a traditional technical solution to build a website. Even today, there are still millions of websites are using multiple pages. Such as those we found that didn’t show our injected video ads.</p>
<p>We all know front-end project needs to optimize its performance. In general, it is about code compression, code combination and a series of related tasks we call them build flow. You will find that in a ‘Single Page Application’ we usually only have one final javascript file. Even though it might be large, we only need load the file once during users access the app(SPA).</p>
<p>However, multiple pages website cannot do the same way. That’s because each page we want to redirect will reload all scripts again. That’s one of the reasons why a multiple-page website will load scripts separately.</p>
<p>Another important reason is that in software architecture, the best practice to maintain a large project is dicing the code to different bulks. We call the bulks Modules. A module could be separated by business logic, object-oriented design, and a particular architecture(e.g. we use Component Architecture in KDP). So that for a front-end project, there are dozens/hundreds of modules under the hood. In SPA, they could be combined to a final script. As for multiple-page websites, they don’t have the similar condition to use the same way, so they have to load multiple scripts in every page of themselves.</p>
<p>Then the Question comes, if they have to load multiple scripts, how could they solve so many critical problems like circular dependency, lazy load, and concurrency order.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, Javascript Communities published more than three Modular Standards during 2013 - 2015. They are AMD, CMD, and CommonJS. They all are similar Modular Standard and have been implemented by a bunch of Module Loader libraries.</p>
<p>So the multiple-page websites we can see, they might use any of Modular Standards. If a multiple-page website doesn’t use any modular architecture, it would be an incredible nightmare.</p>
<p>These content above are necessary knowledge to know our issue about why there are some websites didn’t show the Video Ads.</p>
<p>Except for the part of websites that didn’t show the Video Ads just because of bad network. Other websites all use AMD modular standard.</p>
<p>In our Injection code, we modified a famous 3rd-party library called Hammar.js and imported it to our code. The Hammar.js supports AMD/CMD/CommonJS and a global object(refer to ‘window’ in browsers environment).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the guy who wrote the shitty code didn’t know anything about the Modular Standard. He changed the Hammar.js, but he didn’t implement the module of AMD/CMD/CommonJS. That means he just stuck everything into a global object(window). It is an amateurish way, and it has been proved dangerous code by communities.</p>
<p>The code of Video Ads uses the Hammer.js. That’s why we cannot see Video Ads on some websites which are using AMD standard. When we access them, the Hammar.js will find the current website is using AMD, but our code doesn’t implement the related module. So our code cannot find anything from the undefined/empty module. Then it breaks without any error.</p>
<p>At the mean time, I was shocked with there is no any code to throw or catch the related error, that’s why we cannot easy to find the reason. Also, another shocking thing is our injection code will repeatedly be invoked every 25 ms if the bug is triggered! Only primary school student could write code like that.</p>
<p>I saw the code and feel there are many bugs will come in the future. And we will waste our time and difficult to find those bugs again and again. To fix bugs on it is even harder than rewrite a new one, it also will take more time. Quality takes some time. Right architecture takes some time. Project workflow takes some time. But all of them won’t take us dive into hell at someday when we meet issues. So don’t be short-sighted and don’t think the shitty code works well. This terrible thought will take a technical company to die, and it also shouldn’t be spoken from a real software engineer.</p>
<p>thanks,<br>Yang</p>

            <p>Known my friend Dolphin got a good remote job made me feel a little bit nervous. Surely I am happy to see him finally could get the miserable life rid off. I don’t want to see any of my friends lives terribly due to lack of money. Especially he is so professional as a front-end developer. I felt nervous just because I don’t want to see myself become worse. If someday there is an excellent opportunity is waiting for me, do I have corresponsive abilities then?</p>
<p>I’m not sure. But I know I am falling.</p>
<p>I was listening to a Live from Zhihu at tonight. And it is a speech about how to learn effectively. During the speech, the speaker introduced an app that called Anki. He mentioned it many times in the Live. So I took my curiosity to try to figure out what is the Anki.</p>
<p>After searching Anki from some articles, I learned that Anki is just a simple tool for helping people to remember what they have learned. It will remind people what they have recorded in Anki with a form of flashcards. Just like some vocabulary software, it will use a sort of algorithm to help you to remember the card content and reminds you periodically to review.</p>
<p>Suppose I can try it a few days. But I know that is not the point to improve my current status.</p>

            <p>Sorry, it is 3 a.m. again! I delayed the journal because I just want to choose some something simple. I looked through some technical articles and Zhihu topics a whole night. And I just waited for the time flies.</p>
<p>I suppose I will take the negative attitude until the end of this week. That’s because the leader is going to travel to the US from the next Monday. So he left some ugly work to me today. I feel utterly disgusted with the code from the work he left. I’ve never seen code could be such shitty like the work before, but I won’t complain about that. Just let them play.</p>
<p>Wish someday I can find some friends are similar to me. Otherwise, I will die from the dull life as ditch-water.</p>

            <p>Seems no time to write again. It is late and tomorrow is Monday that I have to go to the office early to attend a meeting which will discuss an issue on the UI design. I am sorry that means it is another careless diary.</p>
<p>My girlfriend complained that her sister’s father always comes to her home and lives a few days to do something in Beijing. The behavior always interrupts her study on the IELTS. That’s because her sister met a problem recently. An investment company took money from investors out, and her sister cannot recall the investment from herself. So her father wants to find the related company to recall the money in Beijing.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is anxious about her IELTS test recently. So when she got the message from her sister that claims the uncle will come again, my girlfriend became inpatient and expressed she doesn’t want the uncle comes. Then her sister was angry too, so the sister didn’t talk more with my girlfriend. The terrible situation appeared.</p>
<p>I could understand why they both all feel unhappy with this situation. For my girlfriend’s sister, it might like two-year work was stolen. How many two-year time does she have? So I could know why the sister was so angry with my girlfriend’s rejection. On the other hand, I also know that if my girlfriend cannot get an ideal score in IELTS, she may not be able to study aboard. For her, how many opportunities does she has to live out of China? That might be another life.</p>
<p>But I really don’t want to see they both become poisonous to each other. I don’t want to see their binding will be broken. Everyone needs to think about their interest for themselves, but they also need to put themselves to contrary position. The simple difference can not ruin So many years relation. Be a kind person, to understand each other. That’s what we expect to be.</p>

            <p>It’s just a normal Saturday. I learned a few hours today but I also find some interesting stuff. That is a manga that called “Les Fleurs du mal”.</p>
<p>It is absolutely incredible artwork. Even though it describes a love story within puberty. I continuously watched it more than six hours. I am totally involved in it. If you guys feel boring recently, I highly recommend you to watch the manga. You will be attracted and shocked by it.</p>
<p>No more time to record today, so let me free on my bed.</p>

            <p>I cannot believe that I was learning the whole night. I read some technical articles, read some documents on MDN, and tried to solve some Katas on Codewars. How positive I am! Unexpectedly I didn’t play games at the Friday night.</p>
<p>Before I did those boring but positive stuff, I watched the rest episodes of the Black Mirror I’ve not watched yet. And I have to say the Black Mirror is an incredible drama.</p>
<p>The last episode which impresses me a lot. It describes how we use AI in our future society, and how dangerous it is.</p>
<p>A company uses high technology to create a race of simulated bees. Tens of thousands bees just like the native bees to help flowers and plants be pollened. But a genius criminal hacked the bees then used them to attack somebody who was considered and selected by the internet users. If they dislike someone, they just vote and curse for him/her to die on a social app just like Twitter. The victim who gets the highest votes in one day will be killed by those bees.</p>
<p>The most shocking part is in the end, the bees killed all of the people who once has cursed someone on the network. It caused more than hundreds of thousands people die.</p>
<p>It is a kind of irony in our network society. Everyone hides behind the screen but exposes violence to someone. Public figures are always being attacked, and more and more of them are choosing to kill themselves. It is indeed the current social tragedy.</p>

            <p>It’s time to write something about PS VR. Even though I didn’t play it these two days, and I even worked overtime tonight more than five hours. To some extent, it alleviates my guilt on those gaming time.</p>
<p>Since I had bought two games and had downloaded them before I got the PS VR, and there is also a demo disc within the box. So I had already been able to play a bunch of games when I connected the PS VR to my PS4.</p>
<p>The games I purchased in advance are Thumper and Kitchen.</p>
<p>The Kitchen is a short demo of the new Resident Evil. And it only has three minutes content to play. I played it two times, but none of any time I could open my eyes because it is holy horrifying.</p>
<p>You woke up in a kitchen, and you were tied to a chair. Your friend was trying to cut off the rope that tied your hands. Suddenly, there was a crazy woman took a knife and pierced your friends heart with it. The man fell immediately at in a pool of blood. With the screaming cry, the crazy woman stabbed you multiple times with the knife. I almost felt the pain, so I closed my eyes instinctively.</p>
<p>Even if it is only three minutes, but I was shocked. My friend thinks that I was brave enough because he even cannot play it with a headphone.</p>
<p>As for another game Thumper. For me, it is just like a kind of music/rhythm games just like what we used to play on our smartphone.</p>
<p>The game takes advantage of the features of virtual reality. And it will shock you with five different senses: sight, hearing, rhythm, height gap and the shake of a controller. It brings you a situation which is a little bit similar to a roller coaster. With the tense music rhythm, you will concentrate when you need to tap with a note. It is not another scary game like the Kitchen. I suppose it will be popular for girls.</p>
<p>Ok, it is already 2 a.m. I need to sleep to revive in tomorrow morning. So let me write more experiences from the games of PS VR in the next time.</p>
