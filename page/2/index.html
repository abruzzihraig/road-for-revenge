            <p>Today is a traditional Chinese festival Dragon Boat. At today, everyone in China will have rice dumpling, which called Zongzi by us. But I don’t have Zongzi. I opened my refrigerator, then I found there was the last can of rice porridge. That’s my dinner for celebrating the festival! Even along with a bottle of peanuts. It’s too poor to happy to me. Anyway, wish my friends in China could have a wonderful holiday.</p>

            <p>Don’t know why I was so negative. It seems like only God knows I am still living in this world. I don’t want to make new friends as it is hard to me to open my heart to others. But I have to face the truth is sometimes I really feel lonesome. I don’t know how to get out of the sentience, but I will keep going on the choice that I made to leave that country.</p>

            <p>It’s a relaxing Saturday. I cooked and cleaned, but felt boring all the time. I can’t help to light up my mobile to see if there is any new message from my friends, but always get nothing from it. For preventing from this lonesome feeling, I took a shower and shaved my messy beard and wore contact lenses to go out for shopping. And finally, I got a stack of snacks and drinks from Asian market. So I proved that saying–food can let you get rid of upset.</p>

            <p>There’s nothing worth to record today. Good news to me is I fixed the bug from the underlying library MST I used. Those guys who maintain the library think the issue I met is an edge feature, so they don’t have enough time on figuring out how to fix it. I made a minimum demo for presenting the bug for helping them to debug, but along with the deeper I dug, the more clues came up to my mind, so finally, I worked out the cause of the bug. That’s the only thing gave me an impression today.</p>

            <p>I didn’t work at home as the past few days because I felt my brain had burnt too much. So I bought a new game DQ builder for relaxing myself. It has half discount in recent activity, so I thought that was a good time to buy. After a few hours had played the game, I could basically confirm it was a right decision to buy it.</p>
<p>Most of the time when playing the DQ builder I was just building my small town. I like the background music around there that really makes me relaxed. On the other hand, there are all kinds of RPG tasks to make me easy to go forward in this large open-world game. I have to say this is the only game that makes me comfortable. There’s nothing gives me any stress in it. That is an incredible experience. Especially when you just went through hard work.</p>
<p>Now I’m ready to take a shower, then go bed to sleep.</p>

            <p>The current project I am developing sucks me a lot. Its complexity goes beyond my previous imagination. Not only the parser that parses javascript, styles, and JSON templates to HTML is very hard work, the draggable feature around the deep tree is also a tremendous challenge to me. With these two parts, to implement a perfect time traveling is nearly hopeless. You shouldn’t record each of individual state to store because there are some actions they should be combined to transactions. That really hurts me.</p>
<p>Currently, the model structure is complicated enough. It at least has five layers: Page Template &gt; Element Template &gt; Column(Layout) &gt; Rich Component &gt; Basic Element. The Page Template can include any of other types. The Element Template can include any of other types except Page Template and itself. The Column currently only has one depth for simplifying the work, and it also can include some of Rich Components and all of the Basic Elements. For a Rich Component, it might have some behaviors by Javascript, such as Carousel, social buttons. For Basic Elements, they are designed to atomic models can be easily grouped by high-order structures. For example, Text, Post, Image, Video, Button they all belong to Basic Elements. And the Post even need to support real-time Markdown editing.</p>
<p>But now I am blocked by some issues that I used as underlying libraries. It’s so hard to me to make the stuff done before the four-month deadline. Anyway, hope I can get some good news after the first month ends.</p>
