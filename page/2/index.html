            <p>It is a special day. My friend Ryan invited me to his home to have dinner. Since the mid-autumn festival is approaching, so he think we should play together to celebrate it.</p>
<p>Ryan is actually an incredible chef, he even wanted to make some moon cakes! But it is regrettable because the flour cannot stick with water and butter. So the moon cakes were failed.</p>
<p>Although we didn’t eat the moon cake, but Ryan still made some other dishes. Those food are pretty delicious, lamb ribs, bamboo shoot and saliva chicken were all eaten up by us. I even thought it is wasting his talent to be a developer, he should have been a chef.</p>
<p>After dinner, we played a board game German Heart Disease. This game needs a high attention to watch if the cards are valid on the board. If they are valid, we need grab to touch the bell as soon as possible, then the winner will get more cards, until all of cards are occupied by the winner.</p>
<p>The game made me nervous, and it is not easy to play. After that I nearly felt tired. I have to say I am not good at this kind of board game, maybe girls more like that.</p>
<p>This is my first mid-autumn festival out of China, but it still made me warm and happy. Thanks for Ryan and Yifei.</p>

            <p>It’s too late to write, I have an important meeting tomorrow, so I have to write less.</p>
<p>Tonight I met a new friend in the game Dark Souls 3. Even though we cannot speak or write anything in this game. We just used our body movements and some limited formatted messages to contact with each other.</p>
<p>We used the difficult way to make each other to know a complex purpose: Invaded one by one to get 30 scarce props. The 30 props finally could make us to get a platinum trophy of the Dark Souls 3.</p>
<p>I should have written the whole story detailedly. I find this friendly guy online is an actually surprise. We finally add each other as friend on WeChat.</p>
<p>The game process is just like the game Journal, It made me felt truly warm.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Recently I have a little bit depressed about my best friend.</p>
<p>He is the only one I am truly admired when I was in high school. At that time, he was good at anything as long as he was interested. Whether it is study, sport, music or game. He just liked a star which is flashing constantly.</p>
<p>In my mind, I have been expecting someday I could have a company with him, and we could challenge this world for displaying some our personal beliefs.</p>
<p>However, it was ruined by the social reality after we graduated from high school. I got a conflict when I was applying a university, so I dropped down to a mediocre university. I lost passion and belief in there. Because to meet an excellent guy is difficult in there. It just like you cannot make a delicious dish in a cesspit.</p>
<p>I was lost a whole year at the beginning of my university. At the same time, my friend had lost something more important in his life. That is the interest.</p>
<p>He lost interest in any objects in this world. The only one he loved is philosophy, but he was involved into a strange situation is that he cannot find significance from anything. This status made him depressed everyday until now.</p>
<p>He dropped out from his university, and became a totally failure in society.</p>
<p>After I earned more, I pursued him came to Beijing with me, to study to be a programmer. So that finally he could get an interesting job by himself.</p>
<p>But I was totally wrong. I felt disappointed for him. He didn’t have a right attitude to learn. He had an ineffective status on studying programming. He didn’t have any passion on it. Because that is difficult to pursue anyone to breakout their cozy zone.</p>
<p>I argued a few times with him, then I was almost desperate. I am not a lucky guy, I have gone through a series of tragedies. After saw his status I had to think about my future, cause I am not same with him. I don’t have a happy family, I have to away from my hometown to find a place truly fit me.</p>
<p>Although I am not in Beijing, I still feel regret about him. I don’t know how to save him to be a positive guy. I want to pursue him to see a phycologist, but he must be disgusted. After all, he is such a smart guy, he has his pride and no one could ruin it mercilessly.</p>

            <p>I was working overtime the whole last week.</p>
<p>After I released a new version, I heard my colleague said no one force me to work hard, and everything I did overtime is what I asked for.</p>
<p>These words made me extremely angry. Because I didn’t tell anyone how I was tired, I didn’t force anyone work hard or work professionally for the work relating to me. I even didn’t tell anybody I released the new version at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>I don’t need a word ‘Thank you,’ but I cannot accept anyone who said I am so tired because that is what I asked for.</p>
<p>Why I have to do overtime on the project because I want to build something professional, I want to develop a project standard, rather than like the kids toys what they did before in this technical team.</p>
<p>I cannot believe even though I have already tried my best to suffer the shitty techniques in my team. I don’t force anyone who just wants keep the shitty work as before. But there are still some people think I have infringed their interest. Yes, because they just want to take money with the relaxing shitty work as before. I even do not want call them software engineers or web developers. They did the work just like any other work which doesn’t need some knowledges or techniques.</p>
<p>I don’t care about your mediocre attitude on work. My friend persuaded me that if you want to make a delicious dish, you cannot make it on a cesspit. Yes, he is right, the team on technique for me is  totally a cesspit. Maybe I shouldn’t pay any effort on those shitty work and in this complacency team.</p>
<p>Whatever your boats flow, work the shit with you is not my destination.</p>
<p>On the next phase, I should rethink about how could I improve my personal interest on the spare time. I won’t work overtime anymore, and I won’t make any project standard. Because even if I make effort on those work, there still are some one against me.</p>
<p>What a small company! There are only six guys in the team. Why it has so many complex office politics!</p>
<p>If we have two kinds of worldview as a programmer, why you didn’t give any respect on my professional work? Am I infringed any interest on you? Don’t you feel ashamed?</p>
<p>Fuck this team, and fuck this work. I don’t care about how bad you did before, anyway you will prevent me to improve the shit better. That’s fine, I won’t play with you. Someday I will meet some respectful and advanced people, all I need to do is enter the team which is appropriate for me.</p>
<p>So I need to change my strategy to make more interests for myself after work. I cannot lose my original intention, and I must seek the destination using my whole life. At that time, you boring guys will be ignored. That’s why I called it revenge.</p>

            <p>These days I ate outside. In general I always choose the Korean restaurant at the corner of the street nearby our office. As I am an adamant guy, so I always choose the same number one of their menu.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also choose to eat some Chinese food in a Guangdong restaurant which named Meiguiyuan, it located behind a street of my home. Although the fast food is easy to solve hungry, and it could save so much time on cooking, I still want to cook If I have time.</p>
<p>On the one hand, cooking by myself could save some money. On the other hand, It also makes my life interesting and significant. I actually enjoy the cooking time.</p>
<p>Today, when I was opening my refrigerator, I saw a bag of gyoza in the frozen box. So I decided to fry them. That’s my first time to fry something on a saucepan.</p>
<p>I called my girlfriend, and I wanted to got some help from her. I put my mobile on a shelf, so she could watch what will I do on the stove.</p>
<p>I was listening to her wisdom, while I poured some oil to the saucepan. But the oil looked a little less. Once I put any dumpling on the pan, it doesn’t have enough oil to wrap dumplings, so the first few dumplings were totally pasted.</p>
<p>I realised the problem immediately, so I did some preparation before the second batch. I defrosted the rest dumplings first, then I poured more oil on the pan. When the pan was not heated too hot, I put the second batch immediately. So that it could prevent the oil breaking out with the ice on those dumplings.</p>
<p>This time I could easily wrap oil on each of dumplings. Since there was a small fire, so I have enough time to turn over every one. Finally they all got a same golden colour.</p>
<p>As for the result, I have to say that is the best gyoza I have ever eaten in this country. Thanks for the assistance from my girlfriend. She made me enjoyable on each boring day.</p>

<p>There is a phrase in Chinese means when you realised something is bad, and you want to change it to right, do not overexert to make it bad again. This is the few word I often recall in my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes this feeling is like playing racing games. If you want to turn right, you shouldn’t turn the steering wheal to the rightmost. Otherwise, you might get a circle in the same place. If you want to drive more fast and more smooth, you have to control the direction slightly. In our real life, it just like balancing your mood and status when you got an important challenge.</p>
<p>We all will meet some challenges just belong to us someday, whether we could achieve the final victory it depends on what strategy we want to choose. For me and for now, the key question which confused me is how to balance the mentality, to prevent me overexert on something specifically, to make myself get a global view.</p>
<p>My paranoid character is also influencing my close friends, especially my girlfriend. It often make them hurt, and it also make me guilty. Hope I could handle those challenges in my life peacefully, without any hurt on anyone at any time.</p>

            <p>I was effective today, I was happy and nothing blocked me on my work until 5 p.m.</p>
<p>My last task is to implement a feature that could use two buttons to control the order of objects which drawing in a Canvas stack. It should be easy to achieve, I even thought it just need to take me 5 minutes.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. I met an annoying issue when I was trying to develop it. The problem is when a user selected an object, for example an image on the canvas, the object will be the front of all of objects. That was unexpected. Because if the user has already selected an object, then he/she won’t see the changes when the two layer buttons are clicked. The selected object will stay at the top of all of objects until the selection is cleared.</p>
<p>I don’t want users cannot see the changing process when they clicked the layer buttons then suddenly get a result they don’t want when the selection is released.</p>
<p>I have used the underlying library Fabric.js, and I know it shouldn’t have this behaviour as default. So I have absolute confidence to consider there are a couple lines of code control this logic in our plugin code. Actually, the plugin code is purchased from a plugin platform, and it has a bad quality. I have to read them painfully to add new features.</p>
<p>However, I nearly took 2 hours on finding where are those code. I don’t know what is the key API method on that, so I have to read the code line by line. It made me angry.</p>
<p>After this 2-hour boring barren work, I became to think if it is a default behaviour in the latest version of the underlying library Fabric.js. I tried a demo immediately on the JSFiddle, and it is indeed a default behaviour.</p>
<p>You cannot find the new change on their documents, and you may also won’t see how to control the behaviour by a parameter if no one posted an issue. What the fucking kidding, it took me 2 hours! I should be at home and doing my personal affairs.</p>
<p>The shitty work ruined my good mood.</p>
