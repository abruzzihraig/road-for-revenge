            <p>Our tester came up with an unreasonable requirement when she tested our work. She thinks as a user she expects that the size of drag&amp;drop zone should be changed by a specific image size. What a silly thought I cannot believe it was put forward by our ‘professional’ tester. So I wrote an email to try to explain why it is an unreasonable requirement and why we should not implement it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For drag&amp;drop zone. I think we don’t need to make its shape related to a particular image size, which is unreasonable in component architecture. Before we reflect on whether a feature or an improvement will look better, we should think if it is reasonable first.<br>&nbsp;<br>At this scenario, the drag&amp;drop zone as a better uploading component will improve the user experience. But it is basically an uploading component first. We should keep every component as possible as pure so that we could easily to maintain and reuse them in the future. That means the business logic should not pollute those components which have a single purpose, such as the uploading component.<br>&nbsp;<br>The shape of drag&amp;drop zone is designed for helping user drag and drop their files handily. That’s why the zone is big enough. If the size of the zone depends on a particular image size, it will bring us more issues on the stability of the project. For example, drag&amp;drop doesn’t know what the size it will accept from users’ choice. If the size is small, it will make user inconvenient to drop the files. If the size is too large(I noticed there would be images has the size of 800x160), keep the same behavior will be unexpected and unreasonable in design. That’s why we shouldn’t implement the ‘improvement.’ Because If the further image size is accepted, then the rule of this improvement will be totally failed. And users may also feel confused with its changeful size.<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s why I don’t think it’s a tradeoff or an improvement on user experience. Before we analyze the look and feel of a requirement from user’s perspective, we should think about if it is reasonable first. The user finally will understand why we did like those rather than totally matched their thoughts at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I received the reply like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand. Thank you for your explanation.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would still like to run this by Kaveh/Yee at a later time as a design consideration for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I talked with a duck? Why I need to take so much effort to try to persuade someone who doesn’t care about my serious thought. Am I only a worker who always listens to the orders from others even the orders are incredibly foolish?</p>
<p>Only God knows what I am doing in this babyish but infighting company. And only one thing I can do is continue to stay in jail.</p>

            <p>Don’t know why my right knee was twisted yesterday. It’s painful, and I cannot easy to go upstairs. I got the similar accident more than three times in the past year. I’m not sure if I have a problem with my knees. I should check it when I return to Beijing.</p>
<p>My father in law made a surgery these days, to cut a melanoma in his external auditory meatus. The surgical result is good, and the wound is small. For now, he is still lying on hospital bed, and there are some relatives nearby to accompany him. My girlfriend also visits him every day. Hope he could get well as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The disease is the worst thing during our life. To prevent if someday we got a critical illness, we’d better do exercise more frequently and do physical examination every year. Otherwise, no life to play will be the most woeful thing.</p>

            <p>I did dozens of requirements for improving some user experiences on our website KDP. Since tomorrow is the final day for our front-end guys to handle code and ready to deploy. So there were lots of colleagues became product managers to criticize our work and put their unthoughtful opinions anytime. I am angry with that behavior by others. If you really care about our work, please put your opinions or ideas before nearing the day when we need to release the final project.</p>

            <p>I heard a tedious argument many times these two years. That is ‘To be an entertaining person.’ You can easily find the sentence in SNS, some people use it as theirs intro/motto.</p>
<p>The words sound like a shameful flag. You could find some words similar in non-mainstream period ten years before. Such as ‘Forgot love’ or ‘Promised to be the angle for each other.’ Does anyone hold the flag to be an interesting person cannot feel a little shame? I guess so. They’ll find themselves stupid someday. And they will wipe the memory as some people want to wipe their childish tattoos.</p>
<p>I call them poser for the behavior titled themselves to be a different one than others. I don’t know why they can get the sense of superiority from discriminating others. But I will accept the tedious behavior as they have their right to build their life.</p>
<p>I don’t want to push myself to be any person or to make myself get a sense of belonging in a social circle. Life is short, and I don’t want to against my heart to be a phony. I know I have few friends could chat deeply on the topic that life. That’s why I really feel depressed every day. I pretend to be a happy guy for everyone, and it makes me tired after I get home.</p>
<p>I searched a man who named Yu Jae Seok today. He is a well-known MC in Korea. I know him because I watched Running Man many times in the past, which is hosted by him. And he always appears kind and comfortable. So I tried to learn more about him.</p>
<p>I nearly took one hour to know what a kind of person he is. Then I found hundreds of comments by lots of actors and singers who are active in the Korean entertainment circle. Everyone respects him in Korea. He is the only one who is thought by people that he could get 99% votes if he participates in the presidential election. Even he has already got a huge success, but he still feels distressful when he wants to buy a new car instead of the old car he used many years. He doesn’t care about salary and also doesn’t show up anytime. He cares about everyone nearby him and helps them get rid of predicaments. If you watched his program, you would believe he is indeed a unique person who could be loved by everyone. You cannot easy to find someone like him in your whole life.</p>
<p>He is my idol. There is an idiom ‘高山仰止’ in Chinese to describe such person, which means showing great respect for a worthy man. Known what he did makes me feel shameful. I just like a normal person who is used to frame others in work and life. Too small I am comparing with him. I will learn more from this kind of person to be a better man. That is an attractive destination for me rather than just to be entertaining.</p>
<p>No matter what, most of the time I just want to live along and to die as soon as possible. I hate everything occurs in my life. Thought I would keep depressed during my entire life. Let me go is the best blessing to me.</p>

            <p>We all know tomorrow is the Black Friday. Please feel my mystery smile:)</p>
<p>I announce that I have protected the Uncle’s smile again. But I won’t speak the company’s name due to my girlfriend is watching me in somewhere.</p>
<p>Also, I finally got the discount of the Novation Launchpad Pro. I wrote it before in my diary. It is an attractive toy to me, and I feel so happy to got 30% discount on it.</p>
<p>Forget the meaningful stuff I should have worked. Let me die within the enjoyable life. I will bear more critiques as I just write the inability of myself on the dozens of journals.</p>
<p>But Uncle is still keeping his smile and waving his hand for me. I’ve become a devout believer.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
