        <div class="content">
            <p>I wrote an email this afternoon for a real case that I was stuck by a terrible code design. It basically expresses how I think about the influence of maintainability from a bad design.</p>
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I just want to give you a real case for how a bad design wastes our time to maintain and debug.</p>
<p>Remember the multilingual parameters for KS Injection that Ruby handled? I said that is a terrible design but I cannot easily to figure out a real case for describing why it is dangerous at that time. And Ruby said we wouldn’t change the URL format in the future, so don’t worry about it.</p>
<p>But I don’t agree with that human promise in programming all the time. The bad design will introduce more unpredictable issues, and today I met one of them. I also want Leila knows that is not my perfectionism. So please don’t think I just don’t want to make code messy. The maintainability is important in our work, a bad design may take a half work time or more when we debugging for those issues that shouldn’t have occurred.</p>
<p>The logic of parameters from the backend is confusing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Peel Insertion will inject an iframe URL from our backend.<br>In default language, it has a format like <a href="http://xxx.com?id=asdf" target="_blank" rel="external">http://xxx.com?id=asdf</a>.<br>But in multilingual languages, it has a format like <a href="http://xxx.com?id=asdf&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="external">http://xxx.com?id=asdf&amp;lang=en</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Note in 1, it seems like a small difference, and maybe it doesn’t matter for the whole system. but it actually makes the related code be complicated more like below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Peel Page will get the parameter ‘id’ from the iframe URL above to fetch data of the peel page itself. And then, Peel Page will use another parameter ‘lang’ to decide what data should be used by the specific ‘lang’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you can see, the default link it doesn’t have a parameter ‘lang=default’, so Peel Page won’t know if it should load data from ‘default’ Even though we can get another parameter ‘forceLanguage’ from the high-level overlay(but we cannot get it from Page Peel directly), the forceLanguage only exists in Preview Mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So at that time, I recommended to either remove the parameter ‘lang’ from the step 1 or give the default link a parameter ‘lang=default’. But I got an answer that is we cannot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Actually, as Kaveh said, all the parameters for Peel Page should only be controlled by front-end, that mean the front-end Peel Insertion should handle all the parameters for Peel Page. With that way, there even shouldn’t have a parameter ‘id’ for those links from step 1. But the terrible design makes everything confusing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So I compromised with that bad way, and I added a parameter ‘lang=default’ for the default link in step 1. Ruby and Kaveh asked me it is easy but why I don’t want modify it. I said it is about maintainability but I cannot give you an example of how the modification will introduce new issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the fix was like:<br>Inline image 1</p>
<p>Note in URL, the first parameter starts with the symbol ‘?’, and the second starts with ‘&amp;’. Since the ‘overlayIframeContentUrl’ it already has a parameter ‘?id=xxxx’, so I just plus the ‘&amp;lang=default’ for the default link.</p>
<p>I know that is not precise, but make it strict in front-end means I have to write more code only for a design problem that should have been thought at the beginning when backend does it. And if I do more validations there, that will introduce more cases that I need to test and debug. It’s another maintainability issue.</p>
<p>So far so good, we just used this patch way to fix the problem that we met. And it took me one day. Because figured out the confusing logic took me a lot of time.</p>
<p>However, today Yee has an urgent requirement for displaying peel insertion demo for our customers. And Yee gave me a new link for replacing the peel content. I thought that is easy, I just need to change the configurable property of ‘INSERTION.overlayIframeContentUrl’ for demo environment. It wouldn’t take more than 3 minutes I supposed.</p>
<p>But I didn’t remember that ‘overlayIframeContentUrl’ will be applied ‘&amp;lang=default’, and I also didn’t notice that the link Yee gave me it doesn’t have the first parameter like ‘id=xxx’.</p>
<p>Guess what? I tested the change I made for the urgent requirement in Chrome and it worked fine, so I uploaded/deployed the new changes to the S3 demo site. But Yee said he cannot get the content. And I proved it again I said that must work fine, maybe Yee needs to clear cache or something. And Yee also let his customers do the same thing and they all failed.</p>
<p>So I tried the new demo website in Safari and Firefox, and I found different browsers have different behaviors. Finally, it took me much time to find the reason just because the normal link ends with a wrong string ‘&amp;lang=default’. It shouldn’t have this issue, but why it comes today?</p>
<p>I took 1 hour to figure out and fixed the urgent issue, and at the same time, I think it may cause some influences to our customers. I think you guys now understand what am I trying to say. The terrible design couldn’t just use patches to rescue if we always ignore the root of an issue, and we shouldn’t always using patches for those terrible and irresponsible design instead of solving the issue use a right way or refactoring. If we live in that unpredictable code from patches, we will use our half work time in the future day by day just for solving those bugs that look simple and can be fixed just by changing only one line code.</p>
<p>thanks,<br>Yang</p>

            <p>I got stuck by inserting SVG into my website builder. It nearly took me a whole day to such work. You cannot easily insert raw HTML into React, but that is not the hardest part. The problem here is you won’t know what SVG format is by users uploading. If you just insert the whole SVG into your React, you wouldn’t control the style on the SVG itself. That means you need to extract those attributes from the original SVG string, then apply those attributes on the new SVG element that created from React.</p>
<p>I tried that way, but I always get some render issues during the SVG creating and attributes applying. So I tried a library which called React-SVG. It basically just receives an SVG file path, then uses another library SVGInjector to fetch the SVG file, then parse it and inject some styles to the new content. Using that way is more clear than the first way, but both of those libraries are not good enough for my requirement. I used a whole afternoon and even worked overtime until 8 p.m. to change some functionalities in the forked repos of these both libraries.</p>
<p>Before I did the work today, I thought the feature to control SVG as a kind of images should be easy, but it took me much time. That’s why sometimes estimate time consume is hard for our developers.</p>

            <p>It’s already 4 a.m. so I cannot write much. You cannot imagine how lucky I am that could work with a talented designer in this messy office. After work, I discussed with our designer more than three hours on the website builder, from functionality to user interface. We always get the same result when we solve any problems from product design or UI logic, and that is really effective. I made many notes for the discussion, and for the next step what I need to do as well. It really makes me excited when working with smart and professional guys. Especially completists would be better. I would enjoy the time working with him and do more fantastic stuff together.</p>

            <p>What a wonderful day it is. I didn’t meet any trouble within the work of today, and I even got apology and agreement from the leader—the argument about coding occurred in last week.</p>
<p>E3 comes these days, but there’s nothing worth to expect except the Monster Hunter World will release in early 2018. Along with the E3, Melbourne’s winter comes as well. Every morning I feel frozen when typing on my keyboard. From fingers to toes, I even cannot feel they are alive. At least, it’s better than hot seasons, doesn’t it?</p>

            <p>Just got involved into game videos in Bilibili a whole night. The anchor Wang Laoju published a bunch of game videos that I favour, especially the series of Dark Souls, which are full of funny and tension. But now I have to sleep for the Friday, also for the following 3-day holidays.</p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
