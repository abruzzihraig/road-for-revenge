            <p>Apple threw out a bomb at the yesterday midnight. It exploded and shocked me this morning. The WWDC of Apple nearly upgraded its all mainstreamed products except iPhone. I was so excited that I couldn’t help to pick up a new MacBook from Apple store.</p>
<p>The new iMac Pro is amazing, but the basic version its price is high up to 6500 AUS dollars, I can only buy one by my current saving. But that doesn’t mean MacBook would be cheap in this upgrading. The version that I prefer to buy needs 4099 AUS dollars. Do they want to rob our normal users? But the high price is always not an issue made by Apple. The good stuff needs taking money or time. Without the either one equivalent, you cannot get the best products.</p>
<p>I decide to buy the new MacBook in the next financial year(after this month) so that I can get some tax returns in the next year.</p>
<p>To Apple: Shut up and take my money.</p>

Now I have to sleep again to embrace a normal late.</p>

            <p>A few days ago, there was an ad of a second-hand guitar which published in WeChat publisher account. It aroused my interest in guitar collection. The selling one is Taylor 1101e, and its holder wanted to sell it as 80% of the original price.</p>
<p>Then I consulted with my friend who has lots of experiences with all kinds of guitar brands. As his recommendation, the Taylor 1101e is not worth to buy as I have already had a better one than that. But he still gave me another surprise–there is an Australian brand of the guitar named Maton, it can be as great as Martin or Taylor could be. Besides, Tommy Emmanuel endorses it! I have to get one in this country. So let’s do more practices first to give the requirement a reason.</p>

            <p>Today is a traditional Chinese festival Dragon Boat. At today, everyone in China will have rice dumpling, which called Zongzi by us. But I don’t have Zongzi. I opened my refrigerator, then I found there was the last can of rice porridge. That’s my dinner for celebrating the festival! Even along with a bottle of peanuts. It’s too poor to happy to me. Anyway, wish my friends in China could have a wonderful holiday.</p>
