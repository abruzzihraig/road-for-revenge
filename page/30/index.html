            <p>Since I worked here there is always a guy everyday I can see in the park, in which I have to get through to my office.</p>
<p>The guy seems mysterious. He always sits on the same bench which back to road. No matter how strong wind, no matter how dense cloud, every morning when I walk nearby the bench, I always could see the guy’s back, the guy’s hat and the guy’s hands are rubbing.</p>
<p>He always looks like a man who is thinking, he doesn’t care about anyone through the road, just shows them his back and his indifferent style.</p>
<p>Sometimes he read some books on the bench, if felt cold he would rub his hands constantly. Other times, I also noticed he brought some weird musical instruments. Fiddled with these instruments but I am sure he didn’t play them. He used a microphone on a stand to record the timbre from his instruments. No one actually knew what he was doing, but I suppose he was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Actually I have a little bit admired on this guy. Living like a kind of artist, even though he might have nothing to proud, and nobody knows him. At least he knows what he have done and what he is doing. Don’t care about other people’s mind, then enjoy the relaxing life.</p>

            <p>How strong windy today! I was going to take my girlfriend shopping today, for celebrating the festival Double Seventh. However it was so regretful, the strong wind saved my wallet.</p>
<p>For the festival, I got off work early today, maybe after half past four pm. I had already at home.</p>
<p>Honestly I just wanted to get more time to play Dark Souls these days, but I supposed if I played the game just after work, without company to my girlfriend, I will take more time to coax her at a whole night.</p>
<p>So I decided to cook for her today. Unfortunately I just can cook a few dishes, and I actually don’t have enough experience to make them better. Finally my pitiful girlfriend had to eat something simple and easy to cook: first is fired rice with eggs and hams, second is beef with chilli. Yes the both are my best dishes.</p>
<p>Fired rice was nice thus nothing to criticise, it should be perfect I suppose. As for the beef with chilli, I forgot the right order to cook them separately. So I had to fire them three times while it still tasted tasteless even though I had already put so much salt. For saving it, I also put lots of peppers on it. Hoped my girlfriend could excuse my poor cooking skill.</p>
<p>If some food cooked by yourself, even though they taste bad, you will eat them up. Might that’s why home cooking is better than outsider.</p>

            <p>Before I left Beijing, I had never bought any chilli sauce. Even if I really like a course named Rice with Godmother when I was learning in university. I can even eat the same one more than 3 months.</p>
<p>But when I came in Melbourne, something has changed in my mind. The first thing I had noticed is that Godmother is so well-known and sold all around the world. You can easily find Godmother in any Asian market.</p>
<p>Eating out is usually expensive, so most of people are used to cooking at home. Of course one of the reasons is we have enough time after work here. Therefore I nearly cook everyday. That’s why I started to suppose how incredible the Godmother is.</p>
<p>Without the Godmother chilli sauce, you’ll always feel there is some kind of flavours missing. Because salt and pepper just can improve salty, but if you try to put some chilli, it actually make you feel hot rather than spicy. In the moment you need going to find another liberator, Godmother.</p>
<p>Godmother can make any food be a delicacy, it has some kind of magic on cooking. I’ve already used it to rescue my terrible cooking many times. And it always works. You can’t believe that I just came here 3 months but I have got 4 bottles of Godmother for different flavours.</p>
<p>Besides, there also is a snack we called it spicy article in China. When I lived in China, I never eat it cause it looks unhealthy and cheap. But trust me guys, if you got another country more then 1 month, and you find the snack spicy article someday, your tears will pouring down.</p>
<p>Thanks Godmother and WeiLong, you both saved my taste scene.</p>

            <p>What a tired day! We have been shopping on IKEA a whole day. By the tram 109, way to eastward, it took half hour we finally got there.</p>
<p>The IKEA in Melbourne is smaller then in Beijing. But actually most of goods are same, you can find words ‘MADE IN CHINA’ anywhere. Also you can find some familiar Chinese words on lots of packages.</p>
<p>We like to buy something which can actually improve our life style. And thanks to IKEA, for its price and consistency on design. I found so many baubles and convenient stuffs which  could satisfy me, especially those goods which could make home more warm. For example, scented candle could make you relax, floor lamp with my wooden desk would be harmony and neat, small storage boxes could take advantage of any narrow space around my bed.</p>
<p>Yes I like the feeling that anything could use all of space exactly, but still keeping consistency visually. I can finally put my iPhone or iPad or something else like remote controls to those storage boxes around my bed. I can’t believe how I could stand them drop down to floor through a narrow gap between bed and wall again and again. Do you know what is the worst thing when I get up? It’s just when I want to close my alarm but accidentally my phone dropped down through the gap. Oh my glasses as well. The terrible scene will destroy my mood in the morning. I’d rather than buy some useful stuffs to avoid this scene.</p>
<p>Sure, the most difficult part is compose those complex furniture, such as cabinet or desk. Yes I spent an hour more again to DIY those complex stuffs. For me it just like to build LEGO but it might make your finger pain. My girlfriend always call me repairman, that’s not without reason.</p>
<p>Tired but happy, hope my environment could be more cosy.</p>

            <p>So late to write today. That’s because I played Dark Souls 3 whole night.</p>
<p>It might be exceeded 60 hours more I have been playing Dark Souls 3. It always involved me when I play it. That’s rarely happens on other games which I have bought.</p>
<p>Yes, may The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the best RPG game as the masterpiece on 2015. And may the Fallout 4 has the similar reputation too. But I never really addict on them, I mean I can quit them anytime if I have anything else more important should be done. Why the Dark Souls 3 is so attractive for me and for anyone else who has played it?</p>
<p>I have to say the author of Dark Souls, Hidetaka Miyazaki, is an absolutely genius on video game. He can build a particular atmosphere which seems dark and unknown that can make you feel depressed. Every game is trying to fawn you and make you a hero or the centre of the game world, but in Dark Souls, you just a no one and nobody guides you, nobody tells you where should you go and which should you choose. You have to explore everything from every corner of the world and analyse any information on your stuff. Using this way could make you feel true just like the real world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, each monster whatever it is small or big, they are totally powerful. Any small monster can kill you during a few seconds. If you died, you will lost all of your souls (a mixture from both money and experience). Although you have a chance to pick them at where you died, It is not easy to get there without another die. And If you died before get there, you will really lose your souls forever.</p>
<p>That’s why it always make players involved, you have to play it seriously even any step you want to explore. This tension make you focus on it and forget time passing. Along with your skills improving, you will get more real senses of accomplishment. It just like a FC game which we played when we were child, any step would be dangerous, also a died punishment is fearful.</p>
<p>That’s why I am attracted into it. Hidetaka Miyazaki knows what is real essence of game. If you haven’t try it, I strongly recommend it to you.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>

            <p>I had a quarrel with my girlfriend just now.</p>
<p>That’s because she leaned the firing scented candle and poured down the candle liquid around inner wall of candle cup. New concreted candle sticked on the wall. She made it bizarre just like a shit.</p>
<p>I don’t know why she always treat me like this, she just feeling good when kidding me. We bought the candle from city tonight, I don’t care about its flavour, I don’t care about how its price. But if it was intact and regular and clear, why she would break it to make me annoyed?</p>
<p>I bore so many things carefully to prevent anyone thought I have an obsessive-compulsive disorder. But I don’t know why there always are someone like my girlfriend want to tease me.<br>You know something if you did, you can not return it back to regular, just like the bizarre candle. It is ugly and I can’t bear it on my neat desktop. How should I do? Just throw it away? It has more than $30, am I rich man? or can I bear it half year? Fucking damn it!</p>
<p>So I just said to her: get out of here, to find another man who can accept you who always making everything messy then feeling enjoyable.</p>
<p>I hate everyone who made my space messy from I was a child. If someone has used my stuff then didn’t bring it back to original position. The anger would spiral on my brain endlessly.</p>
<p>I have already sacrificed something to make me looked easygoing. I know I still mind those things that anyone break any perfect, regular and clear stuff to messy in front of me. If we need to live together, if we need balance something for each other, why always trying to exceed other’s limit. So if I said something cuss and tried to annoy you, will you feel happy or just going to out of home without any words?</p>
<p>I know that’s my angry words. But I am absolutely annoyed. She felt injuredly then went out. But I still staring at the leaning candle on the desktop, or in my heart.</p>

            <p>Today I finally got the desk which I had bought nearly 3 weeks ago. From store! not online.</p>
<p>Can’t believe that everything easy in Beijing but difficult in Melbourne. Especially online shopping and network applying. Those both were hit me deeply here.</p>
<p>Even if I have so many words to complain on network applying, but for the moment, I just want to focus on the online shopping. Describing to you an inefficient flow on online shopping in Australia.</p>
<p>I went to the furniture mall Domayne on 16 of July, with my girlfriend. Fortunately we found a desk has a good price after through a group of expensive woods. Due to my room space is so narrow, I had to back to home to measure if it is acceptable for a new desk.</p>
<p>The next day I decided to buy the desk, so we went to Domayne again. After some conversation I finally paid it. But the elder clerk who was handled my information form, he said the desk is out stock, so they have to pick a new one from their warehouse. ‘Next week, Monday or Tuesday I will call you then you need to come here to pick it up’ the elder said.</p>
<p>Fine, I was waiting.</p>
<p>Monday passed, no one called me.</p>
<p>Tuesday passed, no one called me.</p>
<p>Again, On the Wednesday, I returned to Domayne third time to ask why they didn’t call me. A staff told me the desk has came to the store, I can pick it up then. However, the staff led us to find the desk, but there was no one belonged to us, cause they made a mistake that they picked a wrong type of desk.</p>
<p>So I had to return to home then wait a new one transferring.</p>
<p>After 3 days or so, they gave me a call for notifying me that a new one had been transferred to their store,  would if I want it be delivered to my home freely. Surely I said yes, because the desk is so heavy, if they could deliver it freely, I will absolutely use the service.</p>
<p>Then, I waited 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Even though the distance between the store Domayne to my apartment just about 1 kilometre, it still took 2 weeks to delivery.</p>
<p>And it also took me nearly 3 hours to assemble it, after doing that, I felt I am older then before.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I had bought a Dell monitor P2715Q at the same time from <a href="https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/dell-p-series-27-p2715q-led-monitor-dell/" target="_blank" rel="external">kogan.com</a>. But I am still waiting for it. And Kogan had offered me a $50 git card for their delay.</p>
<p>So missing Beijing, so missing IKEA. Just sharing my tears.</p>

            <p>There is always sometime you feel the inspiration dried up. I feel so today.</p>
<p>When the time close to evening, I found a significant article from my subscription of HackerNews. That is <a href="http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">How to read a book</a>. This article has so much attention from community thus it has been third recommendation on the subscription list today. That actually made me felt a little bit astonished: why the article which just like teaching material from any primary school could be in top 3 of HackNews notification?</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I guess most of hackers are more care about how to learn rather than what should be learned. They may focus on a high-level process that is learning way itself.</p>
<p>No matter what they think, I don’t have any motivation from it. Everyone knows I am learning English without a way to exam, I don’t want to read something only focus on how to quickly answer a few questions after it ends. So yes that made me interested.</p>
<p>I read the half article. It indicates a clear argument: your time is limited in the real world, you need to control your reading strategy and time to make you get high information more effectively.</p>
<p>And It is indeed has some meaningful viewpoints that I have never seen before. The most fascinating part I was learned is that you should figure out the background of the author whose books you are going to read on. In that way you can analyse which part of his/her books is intellectual context. Reading book dialectically then you won’t following all of arguments from an author, so you can prevent some of meaningless parts with prejudices, blind spots, desperate moments or desires from their books.</p>

            <p>It’s too late today, so I have to write less then before.</p>
<p>Yesterday I’ve written that I don’t want to write a journal as a boring flow. So yes I have some new ideas today. That is, focus on one or two points each journal to make them meaningful.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I tried to find some books which could teach people who don’t have any English writing experience or relative culture just like me. The book should focus on how to write rather than just grammar. Through a series of researches, finally, I decided to read the book ‘On Writing Well’ first.</p>
<p>I started to read the book ’On writing Well’ tonight, even if reading it is slower than Chinese book. I just read a few pages on the first chapter, but it still aroused my sympathy.</p>
<p>The significant part I excerpt below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That condition was first revealed in the 1980s, when people<br>began writing on word processors. Two opposite things happened.<br>The word processor made good writers better and bad<br>writers worse. Good writers know that very few sentences come<br>out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time.<br>For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to<br>fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and<br>reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. Bad writers<br>became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy<br>and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen. How could<br>such beautiful sentences not be perfect?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That condition made me surprised, because It almost same as occurring on the careers software engineer or designer. Maybe they are all belong to a career which creates craft.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many software developers after I graduated from school. And I realised there are two opposite ways they are walking on, just like the different writers above. Some developers improve their skills everyday, using much time to think how they could make business logic simpler, how they could make code more maintainable and clear, how to use a better way to balance aesthetics and performance and, how to use advanced parts on programming languages.</p>
<p>As for other developers who just walking on the opposite way, copying verbose code everyday. They often import so many libraries with different qualities to project, then use those APIs with smatter to make the project finally comes apart like a shit.</p>
<p>If we want something tasteful, we want something beautiful and meaningful, why wouldn’t we choose the right way to create our crafts? Also that is why I should choose a better way to write.</p>

            <p>Can’t believe that so many friends had noticed what I have done. Why you can find me? Does the timeline of yours is static?</p>
<p>Fine, never mind. I’ve got change something for the speeding that has been loosing control. But you, my friends, you can still easy to figure out what I am thinking if you are really interesting. After all you are always smarter then me.</p>
<p>It’s a time to record something, although I don’t want any words from my hand such like boring flow. But sorry, it is English, I need more time to learn how to control detailed grammar so as to assembly architecture of article.</p>
<p>Feeling helpless is an indescribable status that always around myself. Sometime it through my body to heart, made me depressed. Everyone asked me why you often seem unhappy and gloomy. Come on guys, there is always a person you have ever seen. Accept me with a little bit different, I’m just a guy who had through so many tragedies.</p>
<p>Today I won’t abuse someone, I don’t want to say fuck you every night in my dream. Actually I fight the man a few times in nightmare.</p>
<p>I’ve been here less than 3 months. So many unknown and funny things came along with me. Everyday I was involved to status ignorant. ‘Anyone who can help me’ I asked for myself on my brain. I’ve got have friends here, that is the most important thing then any other one.</p>
<p>You know I just like a man who from cartoon Polish Man. I don’t like talk with people especially those I did not know. So embarrassing it is! But I need friends here to live, so I bit the bullet to attend technical Meetup. Of course, Chinese guys. Astonishing, so bad I can’t believe they could find a job here. I guessed some of them would earn more then mine.</p>
<p>The meetup is so low-quality, so I don’t want to attend it again. Fortunately I still got 3 guys here. There is only one guy looked has good knowledge as a devops engineer. He just left from Netease then get here recently. The other two guys has a same age with me as graduating from Monash University. Anyway, I got 3 guys as friends here, in addition to the Chinese colleague nearby me.</p>
<p>Those friends helped me fixing so many issues on life. They are all kind person. But there still has something made me felt sad. That is, I noted those guys who has a same age with me always through wrong way on technic and profession, just like I used to be 3 years ago.</p>
<p>No matter what I suppose how should they solve the high-level problems first to prevent falling into traps. Nobody really could feel the source of problems. Continues with tired and unprofessional status, can not get a good job and, do not know what is a valuable part they should invest on profession. With the kindness on work, receive each of unreasonable requirement, then make themselves into the traps. So sad so helpless, can’t break the paper box with the soft body:</p>
<p>Just like a pizza.</p>
