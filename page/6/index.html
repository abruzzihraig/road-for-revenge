            <p>Just finished my work at 1:30 a.m. I was so excited about developing the website builder. And then I got my spring from the unassertive but amazing project MobX. It observes your code everywhere, which means you won’t write those shitty boilerplate anymore. Sometimes you even cannot believe such less code could work for a hard effect! It saves your code and your life, and it also worth to make everyone who uses it to invest a cup of coffee to the MobX team.</p>
<p>More observable properties mean you don’t need to write the rough and complicated logic for handling state sync. Most of the time once we had to handle those situations by reassigning a new value to the old portion, it’s more like that you have to pay more time on controlling the way ‘callback’. With MobX, especially the observable way, those verbose and unmaintainable parts will disappear. It just hides the complexity by its magic under the hood, then saves your life.</p>
<p>It worth to try anyway if you want to get free.</p>

            <p>Occasionally, I found a fantastic band which called Hyukoh. It is the first time I totally get involved in a Korean band. The lead Wu He was born in Beijing, and he migrated to Korea when he got into a Korean university.</p>
<p>I have to admit Wu He is a talented musician–during my experiences on listening more than ten thousand hours, I can only find a few musicians can be defined as geniuses, but Wu He must be one of them.</p>
<p>You cannot define which music style the band belongs. Most of the time you can hear out the British smell just like Mumford &amp; Sons, but sometimes you also can find other styles such as Soul, Funk or Pop from it. The band Hyukoh has strongly personal style as a fantastic Indie band. If you want to learn more from it, I would highly recommend its best album ’23’. Then you will find you would replay each song from the album all over again.</p>

            <p>The backend guy gave me a bunch of requirements for restructuring the final directories and filenames and external configs and so on. That not only took me a whole day for those work that shouldn’t belong to me but also pissed me off. </p>
<p>You cannot imagine how stupid the requirements like. When I was doing those requirements, I even thought I am a tailor rather than an engineer. But what else can I do? Can I just put those shit to my workmate then say him doesn’t know anything about writing scripts? No, I can’t. I just took those history issues repeatedly and polluted my new code again.</p>
<p>Someday, I finally would find a better team to work. When that time, nobody is lazy and likes to put shitty work to other guys. Everyone there are professional and positive. We would do something fancy and excellent in the world.</p>

            <p>I should have written some code for figuring out the library Mobx-state-tree, but the third season of Fargo stole my mind again. However, this time, the story doesn’t satisfy me.</p>
<p>The third season seems that there is no story worth to tell, and most of its plots are separated by unrelated negligible matters around the main line. That makes the whole story messy and unreal, even though it claims the story is true.</p>
<p>I used to be a fan of the leading role Ewan McGregor a period. He was famous for the film Trainspotting he acts. But at this time, he doesn’t shine anymore to me. I can only find a boring and normal actor from his role. That makes me disappointed.</p>
<p>I nearly finished the half episodes in the current season, and I was hopeless about the half, but I’m not sure if the second half would take a turn for the better. Let‘s wait and see.</p>
