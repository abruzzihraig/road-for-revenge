<p>Just record a boring argument with our tester. The tester wants me keep an auto-generate ad title as {adType MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm} (e.g. “Small 12/23/2016 12:54“). And I nearly got insane with the silly requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m totally opposed what you said.</p>
<p>It’s not just about if we could implement it, and also it is how we design and maintain the product.</p>
<p>If for each requirement we just accept it without thinking and implement it directly, I could say I can implement everything by your requirements. I really don’t want to spend a whole afternoon to argue with this obvious issue.</p>
<p>For the 1, please thinking why we have this auto-generated title? The title should be an important info which defined by users. And for preventing they stuck from the validation which could block them to go to the next page, then we add an auto-generated hash title as a placeholder for better User Experience. This is why it was brought here.</p>
<p>If it is a normal user, and he/she cares about their ads and they really want to manage the ads, they won’t create any duplicated title because that would make them confusing someday. And that is also why we used the UNIQUE ID for generating those titles.</p>
<p>And now, you think the title is not user-friendly so require us to make it semantic. Yes, it is reasonable, but please note how the requirement steps up? And what is the basic reason for it exists? It is a UNIQUE and AUTO-GENERATED title as a PLACEHOLDER for preventing blocked users from the form validation, rather than making it user-friendly and making it as semantic as possible.</p>
<p>If a user really cares about the perfect semantic value format like “Small 2016/09/12 23:12:22”, why they didn’t create it by themselves? The placeholder just includes a part of the important and semantic information to help those users someday they actually need those information–those users who are lazy and don’t really care about and manage their ads.</p>
<p>If they actually need the information someday, I don’t believe they cannot get them from a title like {320x50-2016-09-12-23-12-22}.</p>
<p>And why I think it shouldn’t include SLASH, COLON, and the SPACE among them? That’s because I just do more fortifications for preventing changing our code if someday we get a new requirement which influenced by it. Have you seen any format like {Small 2016/09/12 23:12:22} as a filename in your file system? Have you seen the format in URL? Have you seen the format in any username or a form placeholder? The format {320x50-2016-09-12-23-12-22} is program-friendly, it could be parsed easily by any new requirement, and it also prevents some side effects without the special character. If we need to host them someday in a file system, it works fine, and each title by the same user is unique.</p>
<p>For the 2, this is an absolutely bad idea to me that to use the inaccurate words such as “Small” or “Large” to indicate different Ads type. What is the “Small” and what is the “Large”? They are relative units for measuring. Imagine if we have two Ad types like “300x200” and “200x300”, could you tell me which is called “Small” and which is Called “Large”? If we add a new Ad Type “800x600”, You said maybe we could make the “800x600” “Large” and change the previous “Large” one to “Medium”, but can you feel the risk to change those code again and again with those new simple requirements?</p>
<p>If we have three types like “320x50”, “300x250”, “320x250”, how could you distinguish them with those relative measure words?</p>
<p>I tried to think why there are “Small” and “Large” on our website, maybe someone just thinks it is better on User Experience, but it is unresponsible words for indicating Ad types. And it will make us got trouble in the future. Why don’t we prevent it? Xibo told me there could be a mistake in a previous design that there were only words “Small” and “Large” in the form options. But in the current design, everywhere the “Small” and “Large” exist must be followed by a particular size like “(320x 50)”. That is a right design.</p>
<p>As for different languages, for different region use different languages on the auto-generated title? Why we need to do that??? Why we have to make the thing difficult and ugly for this simple requirement. This is a PATCH rather than a wise solution.</p>
<p>This logic shouldn’t depend on a specific UI context. The logic is independent although there is a size type below the title in an Ad Item. It is a principle how we maintain our product with new requirment–do not couple different logic and make them as independent as possible. Otherwise, one modification will bring lots of new issues.</p>

            <p>Australia delivery always gives us surprises. I bought something during the Black Friday, and the estimated reach time is 1st Dec. But I didn’t receive anything until the last Thursday—I got a Left Card in my apartment mailbox.</p>
<p>Left Card is a simple letter to tell you how to contact the delivery customer service and how to reschedule another delivery time. However, I didn’t get any message or email to know when the consignment would come to my apartment. Then I just got the Left Card without any notification. So I have to rearrange the delivery date to this Monday.</p>
<p>In Australia, the delivery time is between 9 a.m.–5 p.m. and only for workdays. If it is fortunate, you will get your package before you leaving home. Or the delivery driver would give you a message before he comes, then maybe you have enough time to go back to home and sign your consignment.</p>
<p>But this time, I was totally failed. There is no any notification when the package will be sent, and there is also no any message before the driver comes. I called the customer service of Toll to ask them if they could give me a call before the driver comes to my home, then they just replied me that there is no way to contact with the driver.</p>
<p>Since that limitation above, and I have already rescheduled the delivery date to this Monday, so I had to ask for leave to stay and work at home this afternoon to wait for my package.</p>
<p>Until 4 p.m. there is nothing change on the online tracking information. So I made a call to Toll’s customer service. Then I just got apologize, and I was told that I have to reschedule another delivery date. Can you imagine my feeling at that time? I even won’t feel shocked if they do the same thing in tomorrow. That is the way Australians like. I have nothing to complain. Hope they love that and live better in the future.</p>
<p>As for the perfect closed cycle that you will never get your package if you work, you have to see it as a God’s masterpiece. But God doesn’t care about how could I get the package in tomorrow. Ask for leave again? If I were my boss, I would be fired by myself immediately.</p>

            <p>It’s the first time I play an AVG game. Since PSN HongKong released a free AVG game Root Letter recently, so I downloaded it immediately and played it today.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t really enjoy this kind of game. I’d rather it is an anime so that I could free my hands to eat some snacks without handling game controller.</p>
<p>Like what I said above, the game Root Letter is more like an anime. You use a game controller to push the story to continue. You could just think of the complicated operations as a series of combination of the operation Play and Pause.</p>
<p>Maybe I just cannot feel it, but I still keep respect on the games of the type AVG. At least, I like some animes which come from AVG, such as Steins;Gate. No matter what, I will try the Root Letter more. Maybe I will change my view then.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>About Three months ago, I got a requirement for deploying our project from backend developers. The requirement is they need a separated config file which should not be included in the final bundle file. That means the separated config file cannot go through the build flow of Webpack to do some tasks such as compression and combination.</p>
<p>The requirement actually doesn’t make sense all the time. I asked those guys many times why we cannot use different environments by adding some parameters in our build scripts so that we could just easy to compile the same project with different settings. However, those guys don’t like anything about CLI. They don’t care using which way to do it will be better.</p>
<p>Since I really don’t want to do some silly works like this, so I put off the task until today.</p>
<p>At first, I just created an individual config file to hold those keys about API or region settings. All the configs have a fallback to the environment which registered in our computer before. So that if you don’t have an external config file, the application will work with the setting which you specified in your computer—also they are written in different ENV config files.</p>
<p>But I changed my mind immediately. That’s because the separated file might be able to make a cache issue—user may not get the latest config if there is a cache on the server. Since we’ve used Webpack, if we don’t follow the rules of Webpack workflow, we might get some limitation there. For example, the final bundle file is easy to add a hash as a postfix to bust cache, but it’s not easy to just give the same hash postfix to a separated config file, which also shouldn’t go through the process of build workflow.</p>
<p>Even if I could find some ugly ways to make it possible that add the same hash as the postfix for the separated config file. If the backend guys just want to keep lazy and only change the separated config file without compilation in the “dist” folder, then they just deploy the code to the server again, all things will be broken.</p>
<p>So I just move the code of the separated config file to inline script in the index.html. Yet I still got an answer “no.” They even didn’t want to see my code and just kept their stupid solution as a bible. How can I do in the fucking team? There is always a dictator with his silly ideas to prevent me from doing something normal or better.</p>
<p>We may argue about one hour for the issue. I just put the scenario like what I mentioned above to those guys. And they seemed got what I worried. Then a guy told me, he could compile all code before he changes the config file so that we don’t need to worry about if the cache doesn’t update.</p>
<p>It sounds right uh? But if we have to compile everything before changing the individual config file, why we need the file itself? I was totally devastated because everything returns to my initial recommendation which from three months before. I asked them again, “why don’t we use a standard way to handle the different environments like many other companies?” They just quibbled to me and gave me an answer “you have to do it like what we said.”</p>
<p>Can you feel that? I just want to fuck the team and fuck the dying programmers. When can I get rid of those people? Only God and the warden knows.</p>

<p>There is a new free game named Magicka 2. The first generation of the game I have played when I was in college. There is no many changes in the second generation. The most interesting part in this game is you can combine a variety of magic from some basic magical elements. It will make you scramble especially there are lots of enemies surround you.</p>
<p>Another attractive feature in the game is to play it with multiple players online. I played Magicka 2 with my friend tonight. In the game, we always kill each other accidentally but also revive each other among the enemies. You cannot imagine how funny the scenarios were.</p>
<p>It’s too late now, I have to sleep now for tomorrow’s work. So I just leave some careless words above to record my enjoyable night.</p>

            <p>As what I expected yesterday, the warden brought a heap of unreasonable ideas to us. He tried to force us to follow everything from his mind, but only one thing you could get from him is that you cannot imagine how arrogant a man could be.</p>
<p>We three Chinese guys argued with him a whole afternoon. Even though he didn’t have any valuable argument, he still wasted our time by his quibble.</p>
<p>He wants to split we front-end guys to different projects—as he just wants to make every project has a person who is totally responsible for the project itself. So that if our boss asks us a specific problem on any projects, then the warden can just easy to put the issue to someone.</p>
<p>That means if there is an issue, someone must be guilty.</p>
<p>That also means we cannot do the part of what we are good at in a project. Each front-end developer must implement all features throughout a whole project, whatever the build workflow, library choose, code style, basic structure, fancy component, you name it. It is absolutely ineffective for us—only two front-end developers—and one is a newbie.</p>
<p>If there is a project which is totally written by one person that might work with his silly idea. But all projects in our company are written by a team. How could make one person totally understand every detail in the project by others? That is impossible. What if one developer has to maintain and change some code on the work by others? He/She may be able to implement the changes, but there might be side effects around there as well. Someday when the original code author found the reason of the side effects, the author may have to rewrite the code which changed by the previous maintainer.</p>
<p>Such an ineffective strategy. You cannot believe that it comes from a man who called himself a software architect. Doesn’t he feel shameful? This is a small company which only have five developers in it. If I have to work with somebody like him, I’d rather drink poison. But I don’t have any choice due to I am still in the jail.</p>
<p>I cannot get the personality which is arrogant and ignorant from some nations, but wish I can get rid of those nations in my future work.</p>
<p>Another thing is if we split our front-end team, which indicates one developer could do everything from top to bottom. That also means I could be fired painless anytime by the warden when he feels unhappy with me.</p>
<p>That’s it, the new life in jail has come again.</p>

            <p>Will tears as the lead is going to back office tomorrow. I will remember those two happy weeks forever when he didn’t stay in the office. Thank God gave me those days without him so that I could fish in troubled water and keep relaxing.</p>
<p>For celebrating that we Chinese guys got rid of the lead’s control, or maybe I should say the warden’s control, we took more than two hours to have a sumptuous lunch—the best Korean fried chicken in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the next two weeks I will be fine in work, but the good news is Christmas day is coming, and they all will have an extended leave so that maybe I don’t have something annoying need to do. But that’s just my optimistic hope.</p>
<p>No matter what will come after he backs, I will try my best to live in the jail.</p>
