            <p>I spent a whole day to watch the latest released drama Narcos season 2. I can’t help to recommend it to my friends. Because it is really brilliant as it based on a real-life event.</p>
<p>The Netflix could be the best drama platform. Even though I have a bad network in Melbourne, it still supports me a high-quality video. On the other hand, the Netflix has already released some popular dramas, such as Narcos, House of Cards, Making a murderer, etc. All of these dramas are very agreeable to me.</p>
<p>I am using the Netflix App on PlayStation for now. Cause I don’t have an Apple TV or a Chromecast yet. Actually, the version of PlayStation is good enough for me. It even has a traditional Chinese subtitle!</p>
<p>Most of conversations in this drama Narcos are Spanish. I am painful if I am listening to Spanish and watching to English subtitles. So the traditional Chinese is really helped me.</p>
<p>Just like the Game of Thrones, from the episode 1 - 5 are foreshadowings. After that, each part will make you astonished. You may feel amazing on how the event could be true. You won’t believe it could be happened in the real world. A drug dealer could have so many authorities, he could control everything in his country, it includes an amy and a government. No one can prevent him in that period.</p>
<p>I don’t want to expose too much content from it. But I really sure I was shocked by it. It has a compact story, and it’s ups and downs. Sometimes you need to hold your breath to watch it, because you don’t know who will be the next died person.</p>
<p>I really want to recommend it to you guys. Good night.</p>

            <p>We got some stage victories today. That is we have released the first version of KDP publisher portal. It should have a celebration in the evening, but we guys were tired, and we just wanted to back to home, to sleep or to play games.</p>
<p>I finally got a rest tonight. The Dark Souls makes me relaxing at home. I don’t know if there are still some busy workdays are waiting for me this month. But I just want to make a rest at this weekend. I just want to play games, and have a good sleep.</p>
<p>The first version has good responses by our colleagues, I think so. Cause I took so much time on it these days, and I swear I have already tried my best on it. </p>
<p>Actually, I was worried about if our colleagues actually know what we did. So I wrote a detailed change logs on the first version. Hope everyone could know what is the actual front-end project and what is the professional engineering way. And hope our boss could know how long we need to develop a professional front-end website.</p>
<p>The worry seems like that if a child got 100 points, he/she will be considered an excellent guy. If a child got 60 points, he/she will be considered an eligible guy. But if a child take some efforts then get 80 or 90 points, most of people still suppose the guy is eligible. Even though the child has already tried his/her best on it.</p>
<p>My colleagues always told me they don’t need a good work, they don’t need any beautiful code, If a customer said it doesn’t need change, we don’t need to do anything. So that I don’t need so much time on work. That is what I really hate. I don’t want to make myself stoop, even if in this relaxing country. I believe someday I finally could find some guys who have the same intentions with me, then we could build some actually valuable and significant arts for our life and for the world.</p>
<p>That’s all, let me play in the whole night!</p>

            <p>I swear I have already tried my best to develop the new project KDP. But I still scare that no one supports me on those work. Never mind, I just need one month to confirm my points and values. If we still get a same situation on such small startup after that, I will quit without any regret.</p>
<p>Today I finished an important work, that is making a professional project procedure. After tried some project management tools, finally I find there is no good project management app online.</p>
<p>I’ve tried Asana, Trello and Teambition. Actually they three are the widely accepted management tools. But I think they still have their individual defects.</p>
<p>Trello is more similar to a to-do list. It doesn’t have a calendar to make a global plan on a project.</p>
<p>Asana is good, and I really like their design. They have the best front-end guys and the excellent designers. But for interacting with team members, it has a little complex. There is no way just like making to-do list cards directly on it. So the procedure for developers might not good as Trello or Teambition.</p>
<p>Among of these tools, the Teambition should be the best. But unfortunately, the Teambition has some bugs recently, and it has bad network in Australia.</p>
<p>So that I tried to find another one for making a project procedure better.</p>
<p>Finally I found it. That is a Mac app OmniPlan. It is so expensive that I have to use a cracked version.</p>
<p>I used it to create a whole month plan on our project. I could make different phases on it. Then I could specify a time on each task. After that, I could assign a developer on those tasks.</p>
<p>After made the whole procedure, the OmniPlan could export all kinds of reports, especially the Gantt, that is the best graph for me to know every detailed part in our plan.</p>
<p>Hope my colleagues doesn’t have any enmity on my work. All of I did just want to help this startup grows bigger and more professional. Please do not think I will take the bread out of your mouth. I don’t have such a great plan on such a small company.</p>
<p>So wronged I am.</p>
<p>Try my best then wait for destiny.</p>

<p>Xibo is a good partner even if he didn’t have so much experiences in front-end. But he is smart and he knows how to learn techniques. At the mean time, he also works hard especially when I ask for him if he could work over time.</p>
<p>For our urgent deadline, for our professional project, and for my personal ideal, I chose working over time to implement the product as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say this day. Hope the tomorrow we could achieve more tasks.</p>

            <p>Finally, I sent the girl away from the Melbourne Airport. She will arrive in Beijing tomorrow morning. We could have five months or more to separate.</p>
<p>I took a SkyBus to return to my home. And I tried to clean every corner to forget something sad. But her pictures are around over the home. I can’t help to miss her. That made me so depressed. I even wanted to buy an air ticket then resign from my company to catch her.</p>
<p>But I cannot do that. I know something here I have to do. I need seek something that I really want.</p>
<p>After a deep cleaning for the room, I made a call for my friends. We talked so many matters about our next five years. We have so much pressure for normal life, I am truly want to be drunk for now.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have to return back to the previous single life. There might be a same dish cooked by myself again and again, until she comes once more.</p>
<p>Goodbye my lover, and see you in the tomorrow morning. Thanks for the WeChat too.</p>

            <p>So sad today. Sweet time is always short. I have to say goodbye to my lover tomorrow.</p>
<p>We nearly used a whole day to embrace with each other. We went to a market to bought some snacks for her friends. Most of them are TimTam chocolates, because I heard it is the famous snack in Australia, so we bought them a lot.</p>
<p>After that, we went to the restaurant Rich Papa again. But at this time I decided to choose something new. I used to choose a same food if I tasted it well at the first time. My girlfriend is in another extreme, she always likes to try some new kinds of foods. It has a high risk. So that sometimes she got some foods delicious, sometimes she got a food hard to swallow.</p>
<p>This time, I wanted to follow her. After ordered the food, suddenly my tears were flowed around in my eyes. I love the girl, and I swore I will never separate from her again. If the next time I have to work in another city in this world, she must be followed me everyday. I cannot bear any day I left her.</p>
<p>We packed her baggages in the evening. Even if she was still at home, I was so miss her. We took some photos with Polaroid, and stuck those photos on somewhere I could easily face to. For example, I could see her on the mirror of the wash room, I could see her was brushing her teeth on the picture when I am doing the same thing.</p>
<p>We stuck ten of pictures to different position. In every image she was smiling. At least that will make me comfort.</p>
<p>I love you my dear, let us cherish the last day you will be here.</p>

            <p>So busy today. For now I am so tired and sleepy, so I don’t have passion to keep a meaningful journal today.</p>
<p>We have tried the angular1.5 with component architecture for our new project. And it works fine for we guys. There just are a few issues about Webpack took us some time actually.</p>
<p>I like the component architecture of Angular2 better than React&amp;Redux. Because the Ng2 gives use more possibility to control some specific rules but it still supports all of essential services for a whole SPA lifecycle. For example, we could use two-way binding on some right situations, we could separate content, style and behaviour to different files. I like that rather than coupling those three parts in one block.</p>
<p>Another thing interesting is our team got a lunch together today. Our boss took us to a Chinese restaurant, which serves delicious snacks from Guangdong. The snacks are really tasty, maybe I should take my girlfriend to eat them tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just a normal Friday, there is nothing need to record, cause I am too tired to write anymore.</p>
<p>Good Night!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Maybe today is the day I spoke most. Nearly the whole day from morning to evening I was talking. Because I need to figure out all of the requirements and the interactions from the product, which is our next project KDP.</p>
<p>That is a successful step as the beginning of the KDP. All I need is just to build everything professional with my experiences. Even if we have to take over time to work to guarantee the product could be released at the precise delivery deadline.</p>
<p>In this morning, there was a conversation for all of the team members. But it just like the leader wanted to complain something like a child. It sounds like: “Come on guys, yesterday such both guys accused me to our boss, and they want to get authorities for themselves. How would you think it? Please choose and stand in line.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why a guy R speak on behalf for the leader so much. Maybe they are always in the same boat. They might be cannot catch our three Chinese guys in techniques. But they want to keep their position and stay lazy and cheap. Because they don’t want to change anything, they just enjoy their current relaxing shitty work.</p>
<p>How hard I was fighting for the basic workflow. It should be easy originally. I just want to take a code review for a week on the colleague Xibo’s code. Only him need to be reviewed, and only one week we need to do this way. But the leader always limited us do it. I don’t know how many times I begged for the leader. I said I could create a private repository on Github, we both just need it to review code during one week, after that, we will transfer the repo totally to Amazon CodeCommit.</p>
<p>But the man always says you can’t do that. “Can we integrate a code review tool on JIRA? ” Or “can we switch to use Bitbucket?”. The similar things usually cheesed me. Because I know Github, Xibo knows Github, and only we both will develop the project KDP. Why have we to learn such complicated things from the leader’s advice? We just want to do code review a few times! Do not control us with his babyish technical knowledge ok? If he doesn’t know Git, that’s fine we don’t care, because we don’t need write code with him on front-end project. If he doesn’t know how to build a private git dashboard distribution, that’s fine, and there are two Chinese guys know how to host the system on our internal server. If you know nothing, but you still want to reject any reasonable advice, finally you want to give us some useless recommended technical solutions, but you never used before. Why hire me to here? I am not the worker for your all shitty tasks. If you want to prevent me work for a product better, just let me quit. I don’t want to be with you on those annoying things.</p>
<p>I don’t know why such a small startup has so many harmful factors. Someone wants to protect own interests. I don’t know what does it meaningful when you have so many titles like Software Architect, Product Manager, Project Manager, and Founder just on such a small company? There were just two developers before!</p>
<p>If you feel happy to reject me again and again, and always let me do some shitty things. I could quit anytime without any pressure.</p>
<p>Whatever we finally secure the right is that we bought an enterprise account from Github. That means we could use Github now to do something professional, that is an essential step to make procedure and product better.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to find all of the questions about the latest design with Xibo. We summarized many confusing issues for interactions and business logics. Then we asked for our designer and the leader more than 2 hours to figure out all of the things.</p>
<p>The deadline is close, but hope we could confirm something! If we did it better than before, then we still suffer the same bad things, I will quit without hesitation.</p>
