            <p>It’s the first day we tried to use Trello to record our daily tasks. I learned about Design and TypeScript more than 3 hours. And also I did practice on my guitar playing. It’s a significant day. I hope we could insist the habit until we could get the victory on the end date of the first period.</p>
<p>The book 设计的觉醒(I cannot find its English name) taught me a lot, even though I just read it 50 pages. As the author and the father of MUJI, Ikko Tanaka is an absolute master of graphic design. He inspires me how to enjoy life with a moderate way like MUJI. We shouldn’t seek the excessive and luxury comfort that exceed what we have.</p>
<p>It would be better tomorrow if I could insist like today.</p>

            <p>I read an answer from Zhihu, which is about how fallen a man could be. The answer really hit me a lot. Each sentence from it seems to aim at me and shoot me everywhere on my body.</p>
<p>So immediately, I came up with the idea that to create a mutual help group. We could defeat our faults that losing self-control all the time when we have free time. Everyone in this group must share his/her daily results from a created TO-DO list. If anyone who doesn’t achieve any item from their plan with a reason that doesn’t make sense, they are asked to put red envelop to others. As well as, they have to write a short review for their irresponsive behavior.</p>
<p>I also created a repository on Github, so that we could push our new plans and updated the results every day to it. It’s a good start to have an opportunity to change ourselves.</p>
<p>Will get better if we insist our plans.</p>

            <p>These days I come back to the strongly typed programming language again—the TypeScript. I tried to learn and use it to refactor my previous work, but the main purpose of using that is just a preparation for the coming Angular2/4 that we are going to use.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if which one I would prefer between the languages have strongly type and weakly type. I like both of them, but I do not like using strongly typed language with a kind of complicated ritual sense.</p>
<p>The type checking could help us find more errors or bugs before the code is being compiled, it has huge advantages for a large front-end project. And also, using TypeScript instead of ECMAScript could get more code intelligence from the modern editors. You can easily check function signatures, and find the references to the properties which are exported. That is really helpful when you want to refactor your code.</p>
<p>With type and interface, we could separate tasks more friendly if we are working on the same project. Define an interface and implement it as its shape. Although we only have two guys will work on front-end, it is still an excellent opportunity to learn something new. That is important to us if we want to find another job. I would also need to learn Angular 2 more after the TypeScript.</p>
<p>Keep practice is the best way to master a language.</p>

            <p>We had a dinner with our clients from Japan in this evening. And I don’t cost them so much, only one cup of beer just made me drunk. I tasted a kind of weird pasta that is made by squid with its ink. I’m not sure if my shit will be black, let us expect that wonderful imagination.</p>
<p>I really admire those Japanese guys, they all have good English skills just like their mother tongue. I know they speak Japanese in Japan everyday, but I don’t know why they could speak English so fluently when they left there. They pushed us have to get in office early these days, that really hit me. I felt sleepy the whole day and kept stammering on everything what I talked to others.</p>
<p>I want to sleep more. Hope you Japanese guys could leave and find other beautiful place then enjoy your remaining journey. Don’t be in the office, please.</p>

            <p>Can’t believe that I was coding tonight until 1 a.m. It is unexpected from both of god and myself. It is Saturday night after all. It should have been a wonderful gaming night.</p>
<p>Since I have already sent a long email to my boss tonight, so I won’t write more as writing practice. I cooked again, in this afternoon. Just fired eggs with tomatoes. I know everyone would think this dish is the easiest to cook, but I never did it from I arrived in this land. It’s a good beginning. At least, I have another choice in my recipes.</p>

            <p>NI-OH is a so awesome game that I was totally involved tonight. I fought with a stack of other gamers in a valley, and tried to steal their armors and weapons. Only the boss at the second stage I cannot defeat so I had to kill more gamers to get the level up.</p>
<p>Another thing is I found a good way to control the state in React, which is called MobX. It is an extremely feasible and convenient architecture for controlling the state by observable pattern. Not similar to Redux, it is only focus on the store and observers, and no more need to learn in MobX.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend.</p>
