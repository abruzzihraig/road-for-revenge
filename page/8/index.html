            <p>We had a dinner with our clients from Japan in this evening. And I don’t cost them so much, only one cup of beer just made me drunk. I tasted a kind of weird pasta that is made by squid with its ink. I’m not sure if my shit will be black, let us expect that wonderful imagination.</p>
<p>I really admire those Japanese guys, they all have good English skills just like their mother tongue. I know they speak Japanese in Japan everyday, but I don’t know why they could speak English so fluently when they left there. They pushed us have to get in office early these days, that really hit me. I felt sleepy the whole day and kept stammering on everything what I talked to others.</p>
<p>I want to sleep more. Hope you Japanese guys could leave and find other beautiful place then enjoy your remaining journey. Don’t be in the office, please.</p>

            <p>I have to sleep early today because our clients from Japan are going to work with us this week. Our boss wants us to go to office early everyday in this week and also off work late. As well as I need to take a shower tomorrow morning so I have to get up before than 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Hope our client Softbank could give us more investment so that I could apply more salary.</p>

            <p>Can’t believe that I was coding tonight until 1 a.m. It is unexpected from both of god and myself. It is Saturday night after all. It should have been a wonderful gaming night.</p>
<p>Since I have already sent a long email to my boss tonight, so I won’t write more as writing practice. I cooked again, in this afternoon. Just fired eggs with tomatoes. I know everyone would think this dish is the easiest to cook, but I never did it from I arrived in this land. It’s a good beginning. At least, I have another choice in my recipes.</p>

            <p>NI-OH is a so awesome game that I was totally involved tonight. I fought with a stack of other gamers in a valley, and tried to steal their armors and weapons. Only the boss at the second stage I cannot defeat so I had to kill more gamers to get the level up.</p>
<p>Another thing is I found a good way to control the state in React, which is called MobX. It is an extremely feasible and convenient architecture for controlling the state by observable pattern. Not similar to Redux, it is only focus on the store and observers, and no more need to learn in MobX.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend.</p>

            <p>Long time no stays on my chair a whole night. I paid my attention to how to refactor the code recently I wrote.</p>
<p>I combined the two independent animations on the peel insertion. Each animation is a huge class which includes a few canvases. At the early stage, I wrote them just for easy to control more states. But for now, I have already got each part that I could improve. So the two groups of canvases are combined to the only main canvas. All of the other canvases just keep off-screen and finally are drawn on the main one. It depends on what state the animation is.</p>
<p>I paid more time on how to make the functions as single as I can. I also made them more readable than before. It is a complicated question in the code, that is what kind of variable should be mutable or immutable. Also, to decide whether a variable is a property belongs to the main context or just belongs to a partial context, it is another thought-provoking issue.</p>
<p>It is still not the best, but I think it could get 90 scores at the moment. At least, if anyone who never saw the code before needs to understand or maintain it, it won’t be a high wall.</p>
<p>I actually enjoyed the time I spent on refactoring. How to construct the code and reduce the complexity is art and philosophy. But I’m not mean that I could be a good programmer who is indeed good at refactoring.</p>

            <p>I made some note by my understood from reading the cookbook of NG2 today. </p>
<p>Here is the note below:</p>
<p>AOT: Ahead of time<br>For compiling code before any browser load it. Used in Production.</p>
<p>Related:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rollup: The utility that do tree shaking. It only cares modules that have Import and Export statements.</li>
<li>ngc: A compiler that provided in the @angular/compiler-cli instead of the Typescript compiler. It has better performance than Typescript compiler for AOT mode in Angular2 application.</li>
<li>source-map-explorer: Analyse the source map generated with the bundle and draws a map of all dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Could reduce the HTTP requests of those resources which are individual dependencies.</li>
<li>Could do tree shaking to reduce unused portions of both source and library code.</li>
<li>Could improve the speed of loading and executing when first load the application with JIT.</li>
<li>Could uglify and mangle the final code.</li>
<li>It only produces one bundle script.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not be friendly with dev mode, it will be slower when the application code larger. And every time we modified the code, it has to be compiled entirely again. It will take a several seconds or more.</li>
</ol>
<p>JIT: Just in time<br>For compiling the app in browser runtime when it loads. Used in Development.</p>
<p>Related:</p>
<ol>
<li>SystemJS: It’s a ES module loader, and it could load any module format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is faster than compile everything in AOT mode so that it is better for the stage development.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>It relies on a browser runtime to compile everything after the source code loaded. That will delay the time could start to use by users.</li>
<li>It needs the angular compiler in browser, and the compiler is large and nearly equals to half size of the whole application code.</li>
<li>It uses SystemJS to load multiple sources such as templates, css and JS files. It might slower than only one bundle file being loaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, it’s the first time I use Keep today.</p>
