<p>Anyway, I will go shopping these days to see if there is any better choice.</p>

            <p>I don’t know how to help my girlfriend to overcome her poor English. She never listened to me on those essential things which would lead us to a better situation. If she failed on the IELTS test again, she might not be able to come to me.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I persuaded her one year before that she should become to prepare her English for the IELTS test. She always gives me an annoying reason for those insignificant things. I told her do not escape from the hard but essential things. However, she never cared about them until she got failed recently.</p>
<p>These days she stayed at home but didn’t see or listen to anything about English. Just slept more than twelve hours every day but did nothing. And she told me that she has lots of important things need to do every afternoon except her English.</p>
<p>How can I save you, my girlfriend? You always drop out your opportunity to make yourself in crisis. You know you are not a smart girl but why don’t you make an effort for those important things and be responsible for your future life? I am so disappointed when you hung up my call as I criticized you. If you really care about that, why you cannot pass those things? Are they really cannot be touched by your efforts?</p>
<p>I don’t want to lose hope on you again and again and all over again. This is not a difficult thing that to choose and to solve the most critical thing on the way to future. I won’t back to China due to your stupid choice. You can escape from every hard work, but please at least just let me admire you once. I don’t want to live like a loser all the time. I don’t want to see my friend or my girlfriend to be always a loser too. Why cannot just overcome such a simple challenge for the future? I am not your parents who could protect you all the time. If you failed on something, you could return to your family, but I cannot. That’s the most primary difference between we both. If you don’t like that and think the pressure from me is too heavy for you, Just tell me you cannot do that—a English test each student could pass by their efforts.</p>
<p>I could have more than one thousand reasons to come back to China except the one called Poor English. So disappointed I am.</p>

            <p>It’s the time to sleep. I worked a whole night on the Canvas. I was really disgusted by the trigonometric functions in code. I felt dizzy when I tried to handle different angles with positive or negative quadrants. And the combined Canvases are too complicated when I clip those shapes with different angles as well.</p>
<p>So disgusting the code is, I don’t want to see it again.</p>

            <p>It’s a normal Sunday. I thought for a long time but still felt there is nothing worth to record today. I slept late yesterday, so I got up almost this afternoon. Read some tutorials of Canvas to think how to make the effect page flipping for ad injection. Then I just cooked for myself—simply fired rice. Finally ended the normal Sunday by watching Infinite Challenge.</p>
<p>Actually, I have much pressure on my work by the last week. I’m not sure if the leader or boss will ask me the process of the effect. I need to get up early tomorrow to make a good impression for those guys.</p>

            <p>I tried to implement an effect that flipping web page from a page corner. It is a requirement by our Ad injection service, and it is designed for switching between the original website and the Ad content more humanized.</p>
<p>In general, it is similar to the effect page flipping when we use some fantastic reading apps such as iBooks. It simulates an exact physical situation when we try to flip a page in a book. I studied the page effect from a blog which written by an experienced graphic developer. He taught us that how to deconstruct the physical effect to a mathematic model, and how to avoid some traps in Canvas on modern browsers.</p>
<p>I don’t have enough experience on Canvas before so that I don’t have the confidence to make everything done on the page flipping effect. I tried to analyze the interaction model to comprehensible conditions to ensure the current technologies could implement the effect on browsers.</p>
<p>I also made some sketches to expound how many difficulties need to be overcome. That is not a simple work for me. I am afraid that my colleagues would complain about it.</p>
<p>No matter how tricky the feature is, at least the first step has been taken.</p>

            <p>It’s just a normal gaming day again. Since I bought a bunch of games from the discount activity yesterday, so I tried them one by one until night. But there is a game which makes me disappointed—the Darksider 2. I can’t believe the game only has 30 fps on PS4. So poor performance when the frames motion.</p>
<p>It’s time to sleep, and I need to go outside to buy some gifts for my Chinese friends and families tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I bought the Dark Souls 2 in PS store before the discount activity ends. I used to think the Dark Souls 2 is a failing work as one of the Dark Souls series. Unlike the first or the third generation of Dark Souls series, the second generation directed by another video game director. So that there are lots of comments said the Dark Souls 2 lacks of the original spirit of Dark Souls. And that’s why I didn’t buy it before until got the discount recently.</p>
<p>However, after I tried it a few hours, I found the Dark Souls 2 is better than what I expected. The instruction set is completely same as the Dark Souls 3. So I could easy and fast to pick the instructions up. As for the perspective on the game, it is better than Dark Souls 1 but duller than the third. It’s enough for my taste. Supposed that I could find more funny stuff in the game.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the last day that I don’t need to work with my unfriendly colleagues. So I decide to invite my Chinese guys to have a Korean fried chicken as a celebration.</p>

            <p>I watched the Korean variety show Infinite Challenge tonight. The special edition which I watched is called The Eraser That Wipes Bad Memory. Each MC in the variety show as a psychological counselor to help strange people who have bad memory during their life.</p>
<p>Each MC seated in a temporary tent which located on the busiest street in those prosperous cities. There were few people tried to enter the tent. So they waited for strangers much time until night came. Once a stranger entered in a tent, he/she would be surprised by those famous MCs. Those MCs used their particular ways to help the strangers to speak their regrettable stories, and gave them comfort. There were lots of tears within those stories. It truly touched me.</p>
<p>After the strangers had spoken their regrettable stories, they were recommended to write those bad memory that they regretted. Then they used a special eraser to wipe the words out. The pressure from the memory blew as well.</p>
<p>So I asked myself: What is the worst memory I want to wipe out?</p>
<p>There is always a clear answer for the question. That is the most regrettable story in my life—I used to steal cash from my grandma when I was a child. I don’t know how many times I watered my tears for the bad memory even today. I don’t know if anyone who went through the event could forgive me from their heart. I cannot hold back to regret the silly action from my freaky childhood. I’m not the evil. I don’t want to be the man hurts the only one who loves him in the world. I’m so sorry for you, my grandma.</p>
