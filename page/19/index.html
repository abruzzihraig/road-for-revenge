            <p>I’m not a man who likes gossip. But recently there was a funny news broke out everywhere. Chinese actor BaoQiang Wang prepared to divorce with his wife Rong Ma. He said he has enough evidence to prove Rong was derailed with his broker.</p>
<p>The news is breaking out in China, everybody is interested in it. The attention of this news is even higher than Rio Olympics these days. Nobody could explain why so many people like to pay attention on other’s private affair. As for me, I even downloaded a news App 今日头条 to catch the latest news from BaoQiang. Why I am so interested in this gossip? What’s wrong with me? I cannot explain it too. I am just curious about it, and I always want to heard some new stories are extremely bad or incredible.</p>
<p>I just want to see the dark side of humanity. And see it though BaoQiang is more presentative. It would be actually satisfied me.</p>
<p>I don’t know who is right and who has true evidence. The only thing I care about is how deep our online friends could dig on this thing.</p>
<p>The ideal ending I am expected is that BaoQiang is a calculating and manipulative man. He lied everybody with his compassionate letter and he just wanted to divorce with his wife to get a new relation with others. I hope he had known everything before he posted the divorced statement. And I hope he knew the trend of public opinions would be totally controlled by himself. Until a few months or a few years later, someone try to explore the truth of the whole thing. Maybe at that time, all of views from these people today would be broken by the mind shock.</p>
<p>I am really expected a reverse story. God please make it come true.</p>

            <p>This Saturday we went to the Melbourne zoo. Although the sky was blue, sometimes there still be slight rain. However, it didn’t appear a beautiful rainbow.</p>
<p>With my girlfriend Dog Xuan, we took the tram 55 which would end to West Coburg from the stop nearby our apartment. There were a few people on the route, nearly all of them would be going to the Melbourne zoo just like us.</p>
<p>After half an hour, we arrived at the gate of the zoo. The ticket price is $30 for per visitor. It is reasonable and valuable I suppose, because there are many staffs in the zoo take care of our safety, and the environment there. They also need to train some animals friendly. So that we could see those cute animals relaxing and happy.</p>
<p>From the entry gate, we got a small map on hand. The map just like a maze, there are a few different routes sometimes made us confused. We started with a rightward route, although it was opposite from most of visitors. Actually, we chose the rightward route just because it is closer to Koala and Kangaroo. They are the most famous animals in Australia. You won’t easy to see them in any other zoo especially in China.</p>
<p>Melbourne zoo is a Xanadu. Every place that a kind of animals lived is totally different. Some of them allow you contact with animals closely, you even can touch them, such as tortoise. Others you have to see via a window or fence. For example, you can only see all kinds of monkeys via a window, because they are sometimes dangerous.</p>
<p>There is a special corridor where grows lots of different trees. Various birds perched on them. We can’t recognise what name of any bird, but we really envied them. If I was a bird living in there, I will be indulged in the paradise.</p>
<p>We also saw a show from a seal, by its feeder. Yes, there still are some aquatic creatures in the zoo, just living in a specific aquarium.</p>
<p>After made a big circle route in the zoo, we finally took 2 hours to finish seeing most of cute animals. Since the map was so confusing, we still missed some lovely animals like big cats and tigers.</p>
<p>Have to say the Melbourne zoo is a recommended place if you’re in this city. It’s an absolutely paradise.</p>

            <p>I hate to write anything after I played video games. Especially when I am so sleepy!</p>
<p>Tonight we Chinese colleagues had a nice dinner together. We are Xibo with his wife, my girlfriend, myself and our new colleague Barry.</p>
<p>Barry is an old driver who is good at everything about how to live better in Melbourne. He is 32 years old, but he still be single. So he thought that we were abusing him like a single dog.</p>
<p>Barry as a software engineer, he graduated from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In that age, he should have good skills and knowledges. Actually he is professional indeed.</p>
<p>We were talking about how to save money to buy a car, how to make a loan for buying a new house. Barry is always gave us some useful advices and experiences. He even know which area is peaceful and safe. As a driver, he told us everything he already knows.</p>
<p>However, I can’t help to ask him a question, how did he pay the down payment? After all, even if any citizen could make a loan of real estate reach to 80%, since the high price of a house, the down payment could be more than $150,000. That is a huge sum of money for me. I don’t know how he could save so much money for the down payment.</p>
<p>He told me honestly that he borrowed about $70,000 to $90,000 from his parents. And he just saved $90,000 when he wanted to buy a house. I calculated it as he said, that means he saved money about $15,000 per year. That should be acceptable for my income. But how long I could save enough money for a down payment? Oh how difficult to live without parents!</p>
<p>Whatever I could have a house someday. Just see the status I am working here as a trip, it would be comfortable.</p>

            <p>When I was a child, my favourite drink is Coke. Actually any sparkling drink I liked indeed until today.</p>
<p>Since I’ve been living in Melbourne, any drink here is much more expensive than Chinese. Last month I nearly expended more than $100 on them. If I keep it up, I can not afford them.</p>
<p>So this is a time to find another way cheaper and healthier to solve the problem. I did a research among various sparkling water makers on online markets. In general, most of sparkling water makers are same. They don’t need electricity. The only one thing you should do is to install a CO2 gas cylinder on it. And when your cylinder is out, you have to refill it in where supports the exchange service.</p>
<p>After comparing a several of makers, from $100 to $250, finally I decide to buy a normal but not cheapest one <a href="https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/sodastream-source-element-sparkling-water-maker-red-sodastream/" target="_blank" rel="external">SodaStream Source Element Sparkling Water Maker</a>.</p>
<p>It supports the canister could store CO2 60 Litres. That means I could use it produce about 60 Litres sparkling water. Although it has a mixed structure with plastic and nickel-plated material, I suppose it is enough for my requirements. It is firmer than the cheapest plastic version, and it also cheaper than the metal version $100 more. It is a cost-effective stuff. Besides, it is free on shipping!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have 2 of vouchers that Kogan compensated to me. I used a voucher to reduce $50 to make the bill cheaper to $89, even if to see it as a toy, I don’t feel bad on the price.</p>
<p>Next step for me is just waiting for the delivery.</p>
<p>So let the life more easier, cheers with our sparkling water!</p>

            <p>What an exciting tonight! I killed the boss Yhorm of Dark Souls 3 just now. No one knows what a nervous experience I had.</p>
<p>The first time I started opening the Yhorm’s door, I noticed Onion Knight is not in there. That made me realised maybe I lost something important within extension storys. So I had to be killed by Yhorm. I was so heart-broken, because I left more than 40,000 souls in there. That means if I want to pick them up, I have to walk to anywhere without using bonfire to quickly transfer.</p>
<p>By searching some useful gaming strategies of Dark Souls 3, I finally found that I forgot to save Onion Knight out of prison. So I have to kill every enemy with a great care to get the prison.</p>
<p>Onion Knight is a fat man sit on the floor in prison. Through into a window, he told me that I need to find a key first. Actually I had already got the key then, but I don’t know where is the door to use the key.</p>
<p>At that time, I was lost in the complex map again. Since I cared about those souls left nearby Yhorm, I had to kill anyone on my way. I nearly killed all of enemies in the whole underground prison! That takes me so much time because I have to be careful when fighting with them. If I died, all of souls would be lost. Besides, I also need save my limited blood bottles.</p>
<p>Finally I found the secret road to get the door of Onion Knight’s room. Onion Knight gave me a best stone to enhance my sword after I unlocked the door.</p>
<p>After that, I started to fight Yhorm again. But I was so careless at this time. When I walked to the Yhorm’s room, I didn’t equip the sword Storm, which is efficient to kill Yhorm. So I had to let Onion Knight facing Yhorm alone, but I was trying to find and equip the sword Storm.</p>
<p>However, even though I was trying my best to equip the Storm fast, Onion Knight still died. I picked up the souls, with addition of new income, it reached to 100,000 souls. After received a few attacks, I was died due to I didn’t have enough supply.</p>
<p>What a sad story! I have to do the same thing again! But Onion Knight has been dead.</p>
<p>Fine, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm. Because I didn’t know how to use a specific skill of the sword Storm, I didn’t know which button should I press.</p>
<p>Never mind, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm, again. Even if he just left the final blow to be died. I nearly screamed then.</p>
<p>I need a little lucky, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. At this time, the worst situation was appeared. I can’t believe that I was died by coming down from a bridge. That means I lost all of souls near the Yhorm.</p>
<p>With a sad breast, I tried it again. This time I finally killed Yhorm, just with few bottles of supply. But so what? I have already lost 100,000 souls and so much time tonight. My mood has already been unhappy. Even though the game is actually exciting, but it was not satisfied me indeed tonight.</p>

            <p>Even though I never thought I was a geek, for the revenge of writing journals, I have to admit I devoted some efforts on it to make the whole plan works better. It even has a little bit funny.</p>
<p>I’ve created a new repository <a href="https://github.com/abruzzihraig/DayOneFlow" target="_blank" rel="external">DayOneFlow</a>, which is my personal workflow for writing journals easier. Since I am a programmer, I have to develop something to reducing insignificant time using. That’s my main purpose to create the repo.</p>
<p>The script is available for normal compiling and deploying, but it still need to update for more essential requirements. I will finish it these days if I have free time. Soon or later I will write a technical journal to record how it works. But today, let us ignore it.</p>
<p>In late today, I tried an excellent app <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grammarly</a>, which is an English grammar checking tool. It could help you find any typo or grammar issue by analyzing your articles. It is awesome especially when you got a premium version. The premium version could give you more advanced advice, and it also calculates a score according to your post. But It’s really expensive, more than $130 per year. Hope it’s worthy.</p>
<p>I tried to modify a post Cozy Space by the Grammarly App. It just gave me 55 scores with lots of issues on right side of the post. I nearly took half hours to make everything right for its check. Indeed I learned many details that I have already known but not pay attention to.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hope we can improve our knowledges everyday.</p>

            <p>Today I eventually got the 4K monitor! It took nearly one month to delivery. The waiting is hard for me. In Australia, we have to face the truth that receiving date depends on how many mistakes would be made by those service providers. That means you need luckiness to wait and do not overly concern about it.</p>
<p>No matter what at least I’ve got them. It makes me happy, and everything is simple and neat. With the melodious music from the Stanmore Speaker, I stay relaxing. I never feel good on jazz, but now, this kind of music is soft and lazy, it makes me remind a lonely game Fallout 4. There are many radios in it play different jazz music around by you, and your dog.</p>
<p>There still are something lack. I need to put a new touchpad at home for avoiding take many accessories between home and office. For preventing someday I lost touchpad at home, I need a new one. Besides, I also have 2 of $50 coupons could reduce on that. Another I want is a floor lamp beside my desk. I plan to buy it from IKEA after my girlfriend left.</p>
<p>As for the new monitor, I was worried about if my computer could use the so high-resolution screen. Due to my MacBook was released in late 2013, it doesn’t have an individual graphics, and the integrated graphics might not afford the high resolution.</p>
<p>After trying it with my MacBook, as expected, It has low performance on some kinds of ratios. But if I scale it as a standard ratio(1920x1080) or as a more space ratio(3840x2160), it is fast just like my MacBook itself. Even if sometimes I might scale the rate to a low-performance state, I suppose it is enough for coding or watching videos.</p>
<p>I also tried the 4k monitor with PS4. But It is disappointing, because PS4 just supports 1080P, it can’t reach the 4k resolution. Moreover, I cannot set the speaker to PS4, that means I have to use a headset on my game handler, I cannot bear it.</p>
<p>How cozy space for me, this one square meter is enough. I have the Internet to find everything I am interested. I have an iPhone, an iPad and a Macbook, they are all best smart devices in this world, look exquisite and high-quality. I have a 4K monitor with a high-resolution screen, and that means I could get a huge space on it, or I won’t see any distinct pixel point anymore. I have both of the best small keyboards, they are same but different, just like a pair of brothers. I have a good speaker and a comfortable headset. They are all come from Marshall, which is the most famous company to produce speakers for rockers. I could use Spotify, Google, and every best app or online service if I want. No more walls like in China. That makes me feel free.</p>

            <p>Sorry to guys again. These days I was so busy from every morning to night. Hope you would understand. To be honest I didn’t write journals these days, even though I have so much words to say. Let me implement them this week. If you want to request me money for my promise, you can just say it to me. Or give me some time to finish them recently.</p>
<p>I don’t want to cope with the journal, but I have really no time today to say a full story, cause I have to get up early tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thanks guys, I’ll return 3 good articles to you.</p>

            <p>Actually I have a lots of things want to be recorded today. But sorry for guys, I am too busy this evening. I handled many things before I have time to write here. And now is 2:12 a.m. I will also get up early tomorrow to catch up an airplane for travel.</p>
<p>Yes I have a travel with my girlfriend from tomorrow to Sunday. The destination is Gold Coast. I guess there must be an awesome place for vacation.</p>
<p>For the trip, I spent so much time tonight, and I also won’t bring my computer to there. That means maybe I can not deploy my new journals to Github. So I just want to ask for a leave, hope you guys could forgive me. Sure I also could write journal on my iPhone. There is an amazing app called Day One. It supports all of platforms, and I even spent 128 RMB for getting a Mac version.</p>
<p>I will take lots of photos on my next three journals, it shouldn’t be disappointing for you guys, trust me!</p>
<p>Today I implemented an important work on the plan Road For Revenge. That is I built the static blog for those journals. It should be looked more professional and serious, Might you guys hope so. I took some time tonight on it as well, to change some code on layouts, change some styles for my specific requirements. For now it is simple and enough to myself.</p>
<p>The most difficult part is also what I want to record here to discuss with you. That is how I could make the whole process below easier:</p>
<p>Writing journal on Day One, then copy it and wrap with markdown syntax to the master branch on the repository Road For Revenge. After that, using commend <code>hexo new post ‘title’</code> to create a post template in hexo engine, then copy the journal which is markdown version to the post template. Finally deploying the new post to Github Pages for updating the blog.<br>Furthermore, If there is any issue has been reported, then I have to fix it among those 3 different ways.</p>
<p>This process is holy shit. I don’t have so much time could be used for those insignificant and what things are easy to make mistakes. I have some ideas on program, but sorry guys I don’t have enough time to say it today. If you have any idea please discuss with me, that would be interesting.</p>
<p>See you guys next Monday!</p>

            <p>Since I worked here there is always a guy everyday I can see in the park, in which I have to get through to my office.</p>
<p>The guy seems mysterious. He always sits on the same bench which back to road. No matter how strong wind, no matter how dense cloud, every morning when I walk nearby the bench, I always could see the guy’s back, the guy’s hat and the guy’s hands are rubbing.</p>
<p>He always looks like a man who is thinking, he doesn’t care about anyone through the road, just shows them his back and his indifferent style.</p>
<p>Sometimes he read some books on the bench, if felt cold he would rub his hands constantly. Other times, I also noticed he brought some weird musical instruments. Fiddled with these instruments but I am sure he didn’t play them. He used a microphone on a stand to record the timbre from his instruments. No one actually knew what he was doing, but I suppose he was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Actually I have a little bit admired on this guy. Living like a kind of artist, even though he might have nothing to proud, and nobody knows him. At least he knows what he have done and what he is doing. Don’t care about other people’s mind, then enjoy the relaxing life.</p>
