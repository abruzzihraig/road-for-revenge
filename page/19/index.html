            <p>So busy today. For now I am so tired and sleepy, so I don’t have passion to keep a meaningful journal today.</p>
<p>We have tried the angular1.5 with component architecture for our new project. And it works fine for we guys. There just are a few issues about Webpack took us some time actually.</p>
<p>I like the component architecture of Angular2 better than React&amp;Redux. Because the Ng2 gives use more possibility to control some specific rules but it still supports all of essential services for a whole SPA lifecycle. For example, we could use two-way binding on some right situations, we could separate content, style and behaviour to different files. I like that rather than coupling those three parts in one block.</p>
<p>Another thing interesting is our team got a lunch together today. Our boss took us to a Chinese restaurant, which serves delicious snacks from Guangdong. The snacks are really tasty, maybe I should take my girlfriend to eat them tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just a normal Friday, there is nothing need to record, cause I am too tired to write anymore.</p>
<p>Good Night!</p>

            <p>Maybe today is the day I spoke most. Nearly the whole day from morning to evening I was talking. Because I need to figure out all of the requirements and the interactions from the product, which is our next project KDP.</p>
<p>That is a successful step as the beginning of the KDP. All I need is just to build everything professional with my experiences. Even if we have to take over time to work to guarantee the product could be released at the precise delivery deadline.</p>
<p>In this morning, there was a conversation for all of the team members. But it just like the leader wanted to complain something like a child. It sounds like: “Come on guys, yesterday such both guys accused me to our boss, and they want to get authorities for themselves. How would you think it? Please choose and stand in line.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why a guy R speak on behalf for the leader so much. Maybe they are always in the same boat. They might be cannot catch our three Chinese guys in techniques. But they want to keep their position and stay lazy and cheap. Because they don’t want to change anything, they just enjoy their current relaxing shitty work.</p>
<p>How hard I was fighting for the basic workflow. It should be easy originally. I just want to take a code review for a week on the colleague Xibo’s code. Only him need to be reviewed, and only one week we need to do this way. But the leader always limited us do it. I don’t know how many times I begged for the leader. I said I could create a private repository on Github, we both just need it to review code during one week, after that, we will transfer the repo totally to Amazon CodeCommit.</p>
<p>But the man always says you can’t do that. “Can we integrate a code review tool on JIRA? ” Or “can we switch to use Bitbucket?”. The similar things usually cheesed me. Because I know Github, Xibo knows Github, and only we both will develop the project KDP. Why have we to learn such complicated things from the leader’s advice? We just want to do code review a few times! Do not control us with his babyish technical knowledge ok? If he doesn’t know Git, that’s fine we don’t care, because we don’t need write code with him on front-end project. If he doesn’t know how to build a private git dashboard distribution, that’s fine, and there are two Chinese guys know how to host the system on our internal server. If you know nothing, but you still want to reject any reasonable advice, finally you want to give us some useless recommended technical solutions, but you never used before. Why hire me to here? I am not the worker for your all shitty tasks. If you want to prevent me work for a product better, just let me quit. I don’t want to be with you on those annoying things.</p>
<p>I don’t know why such a small startup has so many harmful factors. Someone wants to protect own interests. I don’t know what does it meaningful when you have so many titles like Software Architect, Product Manager, Project Manager, and Founder just on such a small company? There were just two developers before!</p>
<p>If you feel happy to reject me again and again, and always let me do some shitty things. I could quit anytime without any pressure.</p>
<p>Whatever we finally secure the right is that we bought an enterprise account from Github. That means we could use Github now to do something professional, that is an essential step to make procedure and product better.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to find all of the questions about the latest design with Xibo. We summarized many confusing issues for interactions and business logics. Then we asked for our designer and the leader more than 2 hours to figure out all of the things.</p>
<p>The deadline is close, but hope we could confirm something! If we did it better than before, then we still suffer the same bad things, I will quit without hesitation.</p>

            <p>So tired today, I was working at home until now 2:45 a.m.</p>
<p>Even if I have so many words want to say today, but I have to take a shower then go to bed. Because I have a new challenge. I cannot be defeated by someone.</p>
<p>Yes, I have argued with the leader during the whole morning. And I tried to expose all of his bad parts and the influences he did in the company. The argument was so drastic, I even said If you force me to do the shit, I can quit now.</p>
<p>The leader said,  “If you try to interrupt me any word, you could quite now”.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Interesting. I don’t know this city. I don’t know why this city has such a kind of bad lier in the position where doesn’t belong to him.</p>
<p>Maybe quit is a better choice for me. Who cares the lier?  Hope I can make the new project best.</p>

            <p>After bearing an ignorant leader again and again. Today, I finally broke out my anger to my boss.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, my colleague Xibo told me our leader assigned a new task to him. The task is about creating a front-end project for our new advertisement distribution system. Our leader let Xibo to create a basic structure and workflow for this new system. Although I don’t think the leader know what is the front-end workflow as his unprofessional technical knowledges.</p>
<p>I was unpleasant for the silly decision. Because I don’t know why no one told me anything about such so important new system. We don’t know what is the deadline and what is the original requirements. If Xibo didn’t tell me the new task he had been assigned, I will get angry after two weeks later when I finished my current work then joining his new project. That’s because Xibo as a newbie of front-end developer, he doesn’t have so many relative knowledges and experiences to hold the basic structure. I cannot understand why the leader doesn’t choose me to discuss how to implement such an important front-end project. Does he think he knows everything on web techniques? Or does he suppose the new system is easy? I just don’t want to expose how bad he as a software engineer to the whole company for now.</p>
<p>And, he even think he is a technical architect. What an incredible joke! Is there doesn’t have any software engineer in Australia? I can’t believe how he could cheat so many kind colleagues such long time. With his unprofessional and unrestrained structure ideas, the company Kakku would be died soon or later.</p>
<p>The leader is always make me restricted. I have so much passion to here to help our team get a better front-end technical environment, but he treat me like a cleaner. I cannot know what is the customer’s requirements. I cannot know what is the deadline to delivery a product. I even cannot control the specific technical solution on front-end. He is so irresponsive to hold everyone to make a product like a shit.</p>
<p>Yes, he is using JIRA to manage the progress of all of projects. But use the JIRA like what he did, I’d rather use a note to manage it. Because in JIRA, no one has any authority to write a new task for themselves. He as a dictator has all of authorities to control everything, but he just assigned a cursory task for everyone. A task may take 1 or 2 weeks. Is that a task for project? No, that is a useless shit for his lazy and dictating personal interest.</p>
<p>I am here just for working for my boss Yee, If I want to do every better thing for Kakku but restricted by the leader. I’d rather go back to China.</p>
<p>So I went to the boss’s office with Xibo after got off work. I showed him my attitude, which I don’t want to be controled by such the leader. If the new project is urgent, we would rather take overtime on work with a right and professional way. I cannot accept his any unprofessional advice on our work. He doesn’t have any competence to dictate his wrong technical orders on us.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Yee will tell the leader tomorrow morning. I hope it is useful. If not, maybe I have to quit at someday I cannot bear the lier anymore.</p>
<p>Hope Kakku is better, and hope my work is valuable in the future.</p>

            <p>The weather in Melbourne is capricious. You could see both sunshine and rain at the same time. Sometimes in the morning there is hot, while it would be cold in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Today, I have had such a rainy day. At noon, I got up from my chair to have lunch — my girlfriend had already cooked for me.</p>
<p>When I opened the office door, the light rain suddenly became heavy. Even if I had a cheap umbrella to prevent the torrential rain drench my clothes. After 7 minutes, when I got home, my pants, my shoes, and even my socks are all wet. No one can predict what weather would be next second. Because after I got in my home, the rain was suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>However, when I prepared to come back to the office, the rain was coming again. I had to change a suit and a pair of boots to avoid drenching one more time.</p>
<p>In the office, my desk is facing a window. During the whole afternoon, I was facing to a bright sunshine without any raindrop. What a capricious rain, no one could explain it.</p>
<p>Finally, when I got off work, the rain came back to a light version again, just like in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people said that you could not predict the weather in Melbourne because any gust of wind will change everything.</p>

            <p>I’m not a man who likes gossip. But recently there was a funny news broke out everywhere. Chinese actor BaoQiang Wang prepared to divorce with his wife Rong Ma. He said he has enough evidence to prove Rong was derailed with his broker.</p>
<p>The news is breaking out in China, everybody is interested in it. The attention of this news is even higher than Rio Olympics these days. Nobody could explain why so many people like to pay attention on other’s private affair. As for me, I even downloaded a news App 今日头条 to catch the latest news from BaoQiang. Why I am so interested in this gossip? What’s wrong with me? I cannot explain it too. I am just curious about it, and I always want to heard some new stories are extremely bad or incredible.</p>
<p>I just want to see the dark side of humanity. And see it though BaoQiang is more presentative. It would be actually satisfied me.</p>
<p>I don’t know who is right and who has true evidence. The only thing I care about is how deep our online friends could dig on this thing.</p>
<p>The ideal ending I am expected is that BaoQiang is a calculating and manipulative man. He lied everybody with his compassionate letter and he just wanted to divorce with his wife to get a new relation with others. I hope he had known everything before he posted the divorced statement. And I hope he knew the trend of public opinions would be totally controlled by himself. Until a few months or a few years later, someone try to explore the truth of the whole thing. Maybe at that time, all of views from these people today would be broken by the mind shock.</p>
<p>I am really expected a reverse story. God please make it come true.</p>

            <p>This Saturday we went to the Melbourne zoo. Although the sky was blue, sometimes there still be slight rain. However, it didn’t appear a beautiful rainbow.</p>
<p>With my girlfriend Dog Xuan, we took the tram 55 which would end to West Coburg from the stop nearby our apartment. There were a few people on the route, nearly all of them would be going to the Melbourne zoo just like us.</p>
<p>After half an hour, we arrived at the gate of the zoo. The ticket price is $30 for per visitor. It is reasonable and valuable I suppose, because there are many staffs in the zoo take care of our safety, and the environment there. They also need to train some animals friendly. So that we could see those cute animals relaxing and happy.</p>
<p>From the entry gate, we got a small map on hand. The map just like a maze, there are a few different routes sometimes made us confused. We started with a rightward route, although it was opposite from most of visitors. Actually, we chose the rightward route just because it is closer to Koala and Kangaroo. They are the most famous animals in Australia. You won’t easy to see them in any other zoo especially in China.</p>
<p>Melbourne zoo is a Xanadu. Every place that a kind of animals lived is totally different. Some of them allow you contact with animals closely, you even can touch them, such as tortoise. Others you have to see via a window or fence. For example, you can only see all kinds of monkeys via a window, because they are sometimes dangerous.</p>
<p>There is a special corridor where grows lots of different trees. Various birds perched on them. We can’t recognise what name of any bird, but we really envied them. If I was a bird living in there, I will be indulged in the paradise.</p>
<p>We also saw a show from a seal, by its feeder. Yes, there still are some aquatic creatures in the zoo, just living in a specific aquarium.</p>
<p>After made a big circle route in the zoo, we finally took 2 hours to finish seeing most of cute animals. Since the map was so confusing, we still missed some lovely animals like big cats and tigers.</p>
<p>Have to say the Melbourne zoo is a recommended place if you’re in this city. It’s an absolutely paradise.</p>

            <p>I hate to write anything after I played video games. Especially when I am so sleepy!</p>
<p>Tonight we Chinese colleagues had a nice dinner together. We are Xibo with his wife, my girlfriend, myself and our new colleague Barry.</p>
<p>Barry is an old driver who is good at everything about how to live better in Melbourne. He is 32 years old, but he still be single. So he thought that we were abusing him like a single dog.</p>
<p>Barry as a software engineer, he graduated from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In that age, he should have good skills and knowledges. Actually he is professional indeed.</p>
<p>We were talking about how to save money to buy a car, how to make a loan for buying a new house. Barry is always gave us some useful advices and experiences. He even know which area is peaceful and safe. As a driver, he told us everything he already knows.</p>
<p>However, I can’t help to ask him a question, how did he pay the down payment? After all, even if any citizen could make a loan of real estate reach to 80%, since the high price of a house, the down payment could be more than $150,000. That is a huge sum of money for me. I don’t know how he could save so much money for the down payment.</p>
<p>He told me honestly that he borrowed about $70,000 to $90,000 from his parents. And he just saved $90,000 when he wanted to buy a house. I calculated it as he said, that means he saved money about $15,000 per year. That should be acceptable for my income. But how long I could save enough money for a down payment? Oh how difficult to live without parents!</p>
<p>Whatever I could have a house someday. Just see the status I am working here as a trip, it would be comfortable.</p>

            <p>When I was a child, my favourite drink is Coke. Actually any sparkling drink I liked indeed until today.</p>
<p>Since I’ve been living in Melbourne, any drink here is much more expensive than Chinese. Last month I nearly expended more than $100 on them. If I keep it up, I can not afford them.</p>
<p>So this is a time to find another way cheaper and healthier to solve the problem. I did a research among various sparkling water makers on online markets. In general, most of sparkling water makers are same. They don’t need electricity. The only one thing you should do is to install a CO2 gas cylinder on it. And when your cylinder is out, you have to refill it in where supports the exchange service.</p>
<p>After comparing a several of makers, from $100 to $250, finally I decide to buy a normal but not cheapest one <a href="https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/sodastream-source-element-sparkling-water-maker-red-sodastream/" target="_blank" rel="external">SodaStream Source Element Sparkling Water Maker</a>.</p>
<p>It supports the canister could store CO2 60 Litres. That means I could use it produce about 60 Litres sparkling water. Although it has a mixed structure with plastic and nickel-plated material, I suppose it is enough for my requirements. It is firmer than the cheapest plastic version, and it also cheaper than the metal version $100 more. It is a cost-effective stuff. Besides, it is free on shipping!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have 2 of vouchers that Kogan compensated to me. I used a voucher to reduce $50 to make the bill cheaper to $89, even if to see it as a toy, I don’t feel bad on the price.</p>
<p>Next step for me is just waiting for the delivery.</p>
<p>So let the life more easier, cheers with our sparkling water!</p>

            <p>What an exciting tonight! I killed the boss Yhorm of Dark Souls 3 just now. No one knows what a nervous experience I had.</p>
<p>The first time I started opening the Yhorm’s door, I noticed Onion Knight is not in there. That made me realised maybe I lost something important within extension storys. So I had to be killed by Yhorm. I was so heart-broken, because I left more than 40,000 souls in there. That means if I want to pick them up, I have to walk to anywhere without using bonfire to quickly transfer.</p>
<p>By searching some useful gaming strategies of Dark Souls 3, I finally found that I forgot to save Onion Knight out of prison. So I have to kill every enemy with a great care to get the prison.</p>
<p>Onion Knight is a fat man sit on the floor in prison. Through into a window, he told me that I need to find a key first. Actually I had already got the key then, but I don’t know where is the door to use the key.</p>
<p>At that time, I was lost in the complex map again. Since I cared about those souls left nearby Yhorm, I had to kill anyone on my way. I nearly killed all of enemies in the whole underground prison! That takes me so much time because I have to be careful when fighting with them. If I died, all of souls would be lost. Besides, I also need save my limited blood bottles.</p>
<p>Finally I found the secret road to get the door of Onion Knight’s room. Onion Knight gave me a best stone to enhance my sword after I unlocked the door.</p>
<p>After that, I started to fight Yhorm again. But I was so careless at this time. When I walked to the Yhorm’s room, I didn’t equip the sword Storm, which is efficient to kill Yhorm. So I had to let Onion Knight facing Yhorm alone, but I was trying to find and equip the sword Storm.</p>
<p>However, even though I was trying my best to equip the Storm fast, Onion Knight still died. I picked up the souls, with addition of new income, it reached to 100,000 souls. After received a few attacks, I was died due to I didn’t have enough supply.</p>
<p>What a sad story! I have to do the same thing again! But Onion Knight has been dead.</p>
<p>Fine, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm. Because I didn’t know how to use a specific skill of the sword Storm, I didn’t know which button should I press.</p>
<p>Never mind, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm, again. Even if he just left the final blow to be died. I nearly screamed then.</p>
<p>I need a little lucky, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. At this time, the worst situation was appeared. I can’t believe that I was died by coming down from a bridge. That means I lost all of souls near the Yhorm.</p>
<p>With a sad breast, I tried it again. This time I finally killed Yhorm, just with few bottles of supply. But so what? I have already lost 100,000 souls and so much time tonight. My mood has already been unhappy. Even though the game is actually exciting, but it was not satisfied me indeed tonight.</p>
