            <p>There were some bad things on work made me unhappy today. The backend guys didn’t sync the public API server with the latest developing API server. They left quickly from office without any message to us.</p>
<p>Actually, more than half delayed tasks were blocked by the backend API. I don’t know why those guys are so irresponsible on their work. Last week we had already met the same situation, the public server was not a newest version. That took us two more hours on releasing process to prevent the side effects from the legacy API.</p>
<p>Never mind, they give me money and the VISA, that is the only way reliable for me to America someday. So let them go, just keeping the technical faith to myself.</p>
<p>For getting rid of the unpleasant memory, I played the Dark Souls 3 a whole night. It is worth mentioning that this is the third time I replayed the game. So you guys could know how much free time I have during the half year.</p>
<p>Since the Dark Souls 3 has already made me feel bored, so after killed two bosses I closed it immediately. I would have watched a drama to instead of. But before I switched to Netflix, there was an idea came out: why don’t try the game I bought yesterday? That is the game The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>I would have decided to take five minutes on it, but from the beginning of the game, I was totally involved in. The Last Of Us just likes a movie, it has extremely strong appeal. Every detail on character voices and BGM are pretty attractive. Each frame on the game could be a nice photograph. It seems a little bit similar to Uncharted 4.</p>
<p>However, the most impressing part to me is the story itself. I just played it less than two hours, and I am not sure if the further story is still interesting. But so far, it just seems like the drama Walking Dead to me. I enjoyed the time when I play it.</p>
<p>The most important thing I forget to say, tomorrow is a holiday in Melbourne, so that I could have three free days to stay at home. However, I’m not sure if I will do something insignificant on the three-day holiday. I wish I could remind  my girlfriend’s name after the holiday.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I’ve been using Webpack more than half year. It hurts me every time when I want to implement some essential features. I was totally confused why there are so many people like its black magic with its shitty documents?</p>
<p>Whatever I complain, I have to say there are some features under the hood of Webpack are actually useful and effective for developing. But these two days, I met some issues with build flow based on Webpack, and that make my tasks on KDP project are delayed.</p>
<p>I have two projects, one named KDP, another named Kanvas. The project Kanvas is an image editor could be released as a standalone version or an embedded version to KDP.</p>
<p>And we use AWS S3 as a static server. So each of those projects will be deployed to different S3 buckets. However, the AWS S3 doesn’t support compression automatically like a real HTTP server, a Nginx server for instance. But we still could compress or make cache metadata for some kinds of files before we upload them.</p>
<p>So the trouble comes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I need compiled and compressed resources from Kanvas to a S3 bucket as a standalone version.</li>
<li>I need compiled but uncompressed resources from Kanvas to KDP, to make developers could use Kanvas within KDP development mode. In this integration version of Kanvas, it need to import two scripts for initialising and controlling Kanvas from outside. The both scripts shouldn’t be compressed or with a hash.</li>
<li>I need compiled and compressed resources from KDP to another S3 bucket, it should be a public website for our clients. Since Kanvas and KDP are different projects, they have individual Webpack flow for themselves. So the process of compressing KDP doesn’t include the code from Kanvas. That means I have to compress code in Kanvas first, then copy the part-compressed code to KDP compiled folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s not over yet. When I upload the final compiled folder to S3 bucket, I used a loader to add different HTTP metadata for each file will be uploaded. That means I have to ignore some files to prevent adding wrong metadata on.</p>
<p>The whole build flow made me hurt before, it always take me much time, and the logic order is hard to remember. Once I made a mistake during the flow, I have to take 5 or 10 minutes to rebuild them again.</p>
<p>So I refacted the whole build flow, I made three different environments for KDP, it includes ‘dev’, ‘dist’, ‘s3’. And I made four different environments for Kanvas, they are ‘dev’, ‘dist’, ‘gzip’, and ’s3’.</p>
<p>Some of those environments have different basic configs are extended to the main Webpack config, especially some different paths. At the mean time, I made our API configs relating to these different environments.</p>
<p>And I also wrote my AWS keys to the environment of my computer, then I could use them when deploy. Except some npm scripts on the both projects, I also wrote some alias scripts on my ZShell to make the complex building logic simpler.</p>
<p>So even though I met lots of pits in Webpack again, finally I got only two commands to handle all those shitty work. And yes, I’m free again.</p>

            <p>We would have a plan to exercise tonight. But we totally failed.</p>
<p>After dinner, Ryan’s couple invited me to the gym at their apartment. Cos we all want to become healthy and to lose weight. We three are developers, so we always sit long time when work. It sometimes makes our cervical vertebras painful.</p>
<p>I replied them ‘Yes, I will be there’.</p>
<p>After I arrived to their apartment, they took me to the gym. But all of treadmills were used by others. We looked at each other, then we decide to buy something from the nearby Coles.</p>
<p>I picked some kinds of apples, black plums, half watermelon, bananas, a bunch of kiwis, and a box of Ginger beers. Yep, that’s what I got after the useless fitness.</p>
<p>It seems like I could stay at home more than one week again. May the food guide my way.</p>

            <p>I made a new plan today for our project KDP in the next phase. Everything was fine but there was only one thing made me hurt. That was I nearly took 2 hours to discuss with my colleagues to explain some plans with my poor English.</p>
<p>Those guys sometimes looked at me with a kind of wired expression. Maybe they have tried their best to understand what I was saying just like I have did my best to figure out what did they think. That is a really challenge for me, but it also improved my speaking effectively.</p>
<p>I like that, that’s why I said to them first “I’m here just want to practice my English spoken with you guys”.</p>
<p>At night, my friends here Yifei and Ryan created a chat group, and force us chatting with English to each other. I pretty like this idea. Even though that made chat slowly. Sometimes I have to use Google Translate, but I really enjoy it. More practices could make us perfect.</p>
<p>After chatting, Yifei as a teacher she caught me lots of grammar mistakes, most of them are just my typos. But I am not ashamed with that. On the contrary, I even felt happy to get those feedbacks. We need to help and to learn from each other to make ourselves become excellent.</p>
<p>Long may the sunshine.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t  haven notified anyone today is my birthday. But since my friend Ryan asked me about some issues in his project, then I thought he should take his laptop and come to my home. So that I could fix those problems effectively.</p>
<p>So I just asked if he has free time on dinner, then maybe we could have a simple dinner for celebrating my birthday. And he answered yes.</p>
<p>He came to my home in the afternoon. We just took a little time on the issues he had met. After that, we both just chatted with each other, and waiting for his girlfriend Yifei to have a dinner.</p>
<p>However, when she came to my home, I was totally surprised that she bought some delicious food for us, and even a birthday cake!</p>
<p>That made me surprised but also made me in a spin. Cause there were lots of dishes still in sink need to be washed, I even didn’t have a pair of clean chopsticks for eating. That really makes me embarrassed. But I was really happy for got such the surprise.</p>
<p>We ate the spicy Korean food, the spicy fried chicken among them is best for me. But they both seemed cannot accept spicy food, and the beers. It made moved, because all of food they bought just be tried to satisfy my taste first. I have never seen such nice friends before.</p>
<p>After dinner, they put the birthday cake for me with the firing candles. Then they sang a birthday song for me sincerely. I was so enjoyable the birthday of my 25 years old.</p>
<p>I am so grateful today, it is the first time I could feel the friendship could make me out of those depression from work. Especially in the city which I lived without any familiar people.</p>
<p>Thanks for Ryan couples.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow is my birthday, but I suppose no one knows it here except myself.</p>
<p>However, after midnight, my girlfriend sent me a message which says ‘open your wardrobe, then find your gift under your clothes’.</p>
<p>I was totally surprised about that, I thought she couldn’t have sent a gift for me, because we are live in different countries now.</p>
<p>After I tossed off those clothes, then I found a white bag. There is a Mac TrackPad within!</p>
<p>I was so moved, because I know the new version of TrackPad is expansive, and I actually want ted to buy it for home, so that I don’t need to remember taking a trackpad between office and home everyday.</p>
<p>During her vacation, she knew I like it but she also knew that I supposed the price is too high to buy. And she thought so as well. We all thought that should not an essential requirement for me. Having it could make work convenient, but not for urgent.</p>
<p>That’s why I was moved, she knows what I liked, and she knows the gift is expansive, but she still wants to make a surprise for me at my birthday.</p>
<p>It makes me recall what I did to her today. I was strict to her Self Introduction which for applying to RMIT university. My words made her sad and upset. I feel so sorry to her, she loves me so much, but I always let her sad.</p>
<p>So that I took much time to explore a gift for her, finally I found a creative stuff that she must like. Wish when her birthday comes, she could feel a similar surprise with mine.</p>

            <p>My girlfriend persuaded that I should sleep early everyday, because sleeping late will make me unhealthy and depressed. Actually, I think so, but that is a really difficult task for me.</p>
<p>I always procrastinate those important and complex things. For example, wash dishes, write a journal, and take a shower. Once I feel one thing need much time to do, then I get scary, because I don’t want to assign my free time on it. I am just lazy, and I want to get more free time after the busy and tired work.</p>
<p>The bad habit has influenced myself from my childhood. Sometimes I even suppose that’s why I am looked older then others who have same age with me.</p>
<p>If I slept late a whole week, then I will be irritable. After I read some articles about that, I did realise the truth of why I am always angry with some irrelevancies.</p>
<p>So yes, she is right, and I am totally applauding to her. But that is not easy for me, I am a guy who like stay waking up before sleeping, then stay sleeping before waking up. The bad cycle could make me get more time after a few weeks. And I know it also could ruin my health.</p>
<p>If I want to be responsible for my family, my friends, and my girlfriend. I have to change the bad habit from now. I wish my girlfriend could supervise me, if I sleep late again, then I have to buy something as gifts to her.</p>
<p>Hope I could get high-quality sleep everyday.</p>

<p>But some guys still dislike me, because my work is actually made them feel to be pushed. They should have written something bad and shitty like before, then get their money from the clients without any effort. But my way is always different with them. So I feel every day they want to kick me out.</p>
<p>I am insecure about the job, and I am so tired and depressed everyday. I am not happy to write more today. Wish tomorrow I could forget something unhappy.</p>

            <p>I had a fight to the leader again. I should have written something here to record the bad memory. But actually I am depressed and I don’t want to remember anything what happened today. Otherwise, it will recall the bad things again and again then I cannot forget them easily.</p>
<p>The sun will rise tomorrow, and wish I could live one day more.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I’ve preordered a package of PS VR without telling to my girlfriend. Cause she doesn’t allow me to buy it. She always says the first version of VR is immature, we need to wait for the next stable version. But I actually cannot help to play it!</p>
<p>Everyday I imagine what if I could play games with PS VR. Is it immersed? Or it still be immature to make us feel unreal. The only thing I know is the sooner the PS VR is released, the longer I will be kidnapped at home.</p>
<p>Actually, only the PS VR is not enough to play, you still have to buy some other devices or accessories around it. For example, you need to buy a PS4 as the host machine, you need to buy a pair of sticks which called PS Motion for interacting with some special VR games, and you also need to buy a PS camera for detecting your position when you move. Surely, you need a TV as well.</p>
<p>Most of them I already have, and I also have a bunch of games on PS4. That means I just need to wait for 13th Oct, at which the PS VR will be released. A few days after that I will get the rest parts: PS VR and PS Motion.</p>
<p>Wish the day comes soon.</p>
