            <p>I did some researches today for understanding how my girlfriend could come to here painless.</p>
<p>I studied from the official website of Australian Migration Department. And I found there is a way to apply a visa for a de facto partner, which must be a real partner and both of the proposers must provide the related evidence such as shared bank account and joint rent bills.</p>
<p>I also asked some details from an agency after work. The agency still recommended that we should get married before we apply for the visa. That’s because it is hard to get useful evidence from China, the AU government doesn’t accept any Chinese documents unless they could be notarized.</p>
<p>That is what I knew so far, and I will study more about the dependent visa application.</p>

            <p>I cannot believe marriage is so close to me. Each of my friends used to bet that I will be the last one who marries. The World is changing, and no one knows what a man will be in the next second.</p>
<p>For persuading my girlfriend to come to Melbourne with me, I took more than half year. There were only three roads appear on our eyes. I go back to Beijing, or she studies as a graduate student here to learn design two years, or we marry to apply a visa for her.</p>
<p>I know my girlfriend is not smart, she even has a little bit naive. I know she always goes back on her words. From the initial, she wants to study aboard in the USA. After a few months, she decided to go to Australia. At that time, she said she would get four 7 scores on IELTS test. I laughed at her and annoyed her. Nearly passed half year, she changed her mind to 6 scores. A few months later, she decided to get four 5 scores and to learn languages in AU before she studies in university. Finally, she got 4.5 scores and said to me she never wants to learn anymore, why I pushed her so much, and why she needs to waste the expensive tuition. In the meantime, she got a new interest again—Tattoo. Every day she told me she would be a tattooist, even though she never had the relative experience before two months ago.</p>
<p>Such a simple girl persuaded everyone includes her parents and me. Won’t learn anymore, and will marry to me to live together. I am not sure if I am sober. Maybe my mentality has changed in these years. I know she has such defects, but I still love her. Even though we might have argument sometimes, but most of the time we were happy together. She is such a kind and lovely girl; sometimes I even want a daughter like her. I don’t want a savvy woman to help me to construct our family and careers. She gives me happiness all the time, and I think that’s enough for getting a shared future.</p>
<p>This afternoon, she told her parents our ideas. Her parents truly love her more than me. They finally agreed her decision. If she actually doesn’t want to learn, why don’t give her freedom and happiness? I have already got an excellent opportunity to get the PR so that she doesn’t need to pay so much effort to come with me. That’s my duty to take care of her.</p>
<p>She told her parents that we might be able to get marriage certificate first. Then I could use it to apply a working visa for her to live in Melbourne. She could learn languages in some courses if she needs. Also, any free time she could learn and try to be a tattooist. If I were in China, I wouldn’t think about the idea a second. I’m not sure if it is a right way to make us happy or enjoyable for the future life. I hope we could figure out those tough issues during the road. If we need money, I will pay more efforts with my smart brain. If we need responsibility, I will learn and reflect more on what I did. Hope her could understand my heart.</p>
<p>As my imagination, to marry her after two or three years could be better. At that time, we could have the PR. I may get an ideal job. She will have a good English skill and a little work experience. That will make us learn more from each other; then we may know how hard to live in this cruel society and the world. It will be the best life experience to teach us how to cherish each other.</p>
<p>Finally, It would be better if she could study as a graduate student. That’s because I haven’t prepared anything about marriage. It is enormous pressure for me, and I don’t want to give my future wife a cheap memory.</p>
<p>Stress!</p>

            <p>Hmm… I lost my words again. Paid a whole night to try the recently best sold game NI-OH. Since there are so many articles says how good the NI-OH is, and IGN even gave it a 9.6 high score, so I cannot help to check if it is indeed an amazing game. By the way, the NI-OH has been sold out in Japan.</p>
<p>The NI-OH seems like the game Bloodborne. You can find lots of similar features between they both. For example, in NI-OH you only have one life, if you died, you have only one opportunity to pick up the souls(kill enemies could gain their souls just like Dark Souls) you lost in which you died. But if you died during the road again, you will lose the souls that you had gained forever.</p>
<p>Also, the NI-OH has similar difficulty with Bloodborne. Unless you use the unique skill—by collecting anger and killing lots of enemies, otherwise you could be killed by any of medium-level enemies with their combos.</p>
<p>It’s a good game, but it cannot be compared with Bloodborne or Dark Souls. It’s more like Dark Souls 2. I don’t like so many enemies in a complicated map.</p>

            <p>I took more than 15 hours on the flight from Melbourne to Beijing and finally got my girlfriend’s home. So I missed the journal yesterday. Also, I found that during this holiday I won’t have so much time to write journals as I want to pay more time with my friends and families. So the journal plan would be frozen until I come to Melbourne.</p>

            <p>Thanks to my bro Dolphin. By his help, I finally understand the knowledge how does canvas effect on different resolutions. The problem has puzzled me a few years, but I have never been trying to figure it out. Whatever, it’s not too late. But it made me dizzy a while.</p>
<p>Like what I said before, I really feel sick with the graphics code. Even though I just used some basic mathematics I learned from my high school. It doesn’t mean it’s easy to write by coding. The code is more abstract than equation on paper. Also, you can draw some shapes on your draft, but you cannot write a comment that is easy to understand in code. Once you met any issue or bug, you have to stop everything before you understand what you did in the previous code. That really makes me discouraged.</p>
<p>In programming, you may need to be more careful on those edge conditions. Such as a divisor must not be zero, a slope could be infinite. You have to take care of every edge condition on your code to prevent those bugs which are hard to test.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may take much time to maintain your logic, and the situations you write more, the complexity would be harder. Today, when I found my conditions were written in draw function became more and more complicated, I tried to recreate the basic mathematical model of these complicated parts. After two hours, all the things got done with a clear way. That is the hardest part for me–you won’t know what is the best way before you taste bitterness in graphics programming, and, the cost is expensive.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’m not a genius, as well as I’m not good at math. So I can just keep admiring on those guys who really like to do awesome stuff with graphics by coding.</p>

<p>For the recent work, all the things in my part look well. I may give them a demo before I leave.</p>
<p>It’s a happy waiting time to me. Just keep relaxing and enjoy the next two workdays.</p>

            <p>I worked overtime tonight to support those outdated browsers. I made some fallback ways for keeping the effect page flipping consistent among all popular browsers.</p>
<p>From tomorrow, I will apply shadow textures on the effect to make it more natural. Ideally post a demo online before I leave should be a good work to me. Hope everything that I will handle is well. Because I don’t know how much time I have spent for handling those browser compatibility issues.</p>

            <p>I was shopping a whole day for preparing gifts to my relatives and friends. Since my trunk has enough space so I have to buy something small. Hence the most ideal gift to me is health product.</p>
<p>I went to a pharmacy to buy a case of Swisses products—which is a famous brand around the world and from Melbourne. I studied how to choose a health product online and knew which product could improve the relative symptom. Then I made a Todo list for those health products that will be purchased.</p>
<p>There are still some gifts for my nephews and my girlfriend haven’t been purchased yet. Maybe I will go shopping more times before I leave.</p>
<p>Need to sleep and to meet next Monday.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>

                    All of themes are shit on Hexo except this funny one. Thanks for the desinger Jonathan Klughertz. So that I could use it to leverage my journals performed better.
