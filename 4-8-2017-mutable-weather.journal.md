### Mutable Weather
I used to describe my leader’s mood by the weather of Melbourne. The weather in Melbourne is such mutable that you cannot guess what the weather would change at the next second. Like today, the sunshine was still shining, but suddenly the rain came. You can look through golden sun from the rain falls, which is an amazing miracle.

I would have bought new shoes this afternoon, but the rain blocked my plan. My ex-colleagues will come to Melbourne tomorrow, so I need to take them to enjoy this city. But I don’t have a pair of comfortable shoes because I just wear flip flops a few months.

Look my mustache and my flip flops. You cannot imagine how lazy I have been becoming. It seems there would be a long-time test on my physical strength in tomorrow. I really want to skip tomorrow.
