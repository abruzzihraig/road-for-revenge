### Dedicate Ourselves To Everything
I helped my girlfriend to modify her article of a design work.

But we were not pleased. Because after I fixed some issues in her English, I found there were no any sentence in Chinese part is correct. That made me unhappy, because I thought she was irresponsible for her work.

She doesn’t have a good English skill just like me. So she did the Chinese notes first, then she tried to translate them to English. But translating Chinese to English literally is not a wise solution. Because they have some differences on the grammar.

I thought we could implement the Chinese part first. But we have to ensure the Chinese part has whole logic and appearance, and any user could feel the main purpose from the words. A good article should make everyone knows what is the author wants to describe.

However, when I focused on her Chinese part, I can’t believe my girlfriend wrote just like a nine-year-old child. The Chinese grammar errors were exposed everywhere. The logic has so many critical faults. Some words are repetitive, especially the subject word ‘I’ and some useless conjunctions.

It cannot make sense easily, a thousand people could have a thousand views on her article. That is what I cannot acceptable! Because the article is about her design work for applying a university. That’s why I was so angry, because that is a really important thing about her life and for her future. She cannot be so irresponsible on her life, I dislike that.

Although I was critical of her article, and she was upset as well, I still want to make her realising how to make things better and how to make matters professional. There is only a  kind of person I admire, that is dedicated themselves to each important thing.
