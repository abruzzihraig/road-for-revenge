### Dead Man
Don't know why I was so negative. It seems like only God knows I am still living in this world. I don’t want to make new friends as it is hard to me to open my heart to others. But I have to face the truth is sometimes I really feel lonesome. I don’t know how to get out of the sentience, but I will keep going on the choice that I made to leave that country.
