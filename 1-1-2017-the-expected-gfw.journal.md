### The Expected GFW
There are only 18 days before I come to China. So I started to update my VPN service on both of servers and clients.

I have to say Surge is the best software for the purpose of network proxy. You can proxy any network requirement on your devices. The new version Mac Surge 2 has a dashboard, which could make monitoring the network on your device easier. And also, the author is absolutely generous. If you have bought an iOS Surge before, you could claim a license for the new Mac Surge 2. Trust me, it is beyond its price.

I have had two VPSs run ShadowSocks all the time. But there is only one defect that I don’t have a Chinese server. So I cannot access overseas any video or music which has a Chinese copyright limitation. Wish someone could share the Chinese VPS with me.

Tomorrow is still the holiday of the New Year’s Day. So let me have a relaxing sleep.
