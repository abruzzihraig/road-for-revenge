### Happy New Year
This is the last day of 2016. Everyone in my friend circle posted their summaries of the year. But I didn’t and I won’t do it. That’s because the fallen time doesn’t worth to sum. Actually, I have more than ten thousands words to be written, especially which I learned and felt a heap of matters during this year overseas.

Just bury my words with my fallen spirit.
