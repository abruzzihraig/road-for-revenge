### Normal Sunday IV
I’m going to sleep early today so let me finish this work ASAP. It’s a normal Sunday, and it indeed has nothing worth to record. I just watched variety shows, cooked those food which going to go bad in my refrigerator. That’s all the day I did. The recent temperature is dropping. Hope next week we can have some sunny days.
