### Dependent Visa
I did some researches today for understanding how my girlfriend could come to here painless.

I studied from the official website of Australian Migration Department. And I found there is a way to apply a visa for a de facto partner, which must be a real partner and both of the proposers must provide the related evidence such as shared bank account and joint rent bills.

I also asked some details from an agency after work. The agency still recommended that we should get married before we apply for the visa. That's because it is hard to get useful evidence from China, the AU government doesn't accept any Chinese documents unless they could be notarized.

That is what I knew so far, and I will study more about the dependent visa application.
