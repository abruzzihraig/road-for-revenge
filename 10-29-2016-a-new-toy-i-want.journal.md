### A New Toy I Want
I found an attractive toy these days. It called Launchpad that produced by Novation.

The Launchpad is a music clips controller, and it also is a perform instrument. It could be stuck with the live music editing software Ableton. We can use the pad to record different clips and adjust the different tracks to make some excellent remix music.

I don't know much on that because it is a complicated device, there might be more than hundreds combined keys could be used for different functionalities. The only think I know is there are four main modes on the top of Launchpad, and when we want to play it as an instrument, we need to switch it to the mode Note.

I called it a toy because it has a colorful RGB lights on the panel. It has 8x8 blocks on it, and each of them is programmable. So some people did lots of related projects with dazzling light when performing a remix music.

I am not sure whether I will play it frequently if I bought it. But for these days, I was indeed attracted to it. My girlfriend seems doesn't like it. Even though it doesn't have a high price, I still need to think about if I will buy it.
