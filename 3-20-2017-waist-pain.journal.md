### Waist Pain
I donâ€™t know why my waist is so pain tonight, I even cannot sit on chair. It might be caused by I practicing guitar with a wrong posture.

I found a funny British guy on Youtube when I was learning English spoken. The guy masters Chinese and posted a stack of videos online. From those funny videos I understand why Chinese is the language that most difficult to learn. And also the guy describes why the discrimination exists when different nations cannot understand each other by different languages. It really opens my eyes.
