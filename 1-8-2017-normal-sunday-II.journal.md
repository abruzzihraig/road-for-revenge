### Normal Sunday II
It’s a normal Sunday. I thought for a long time but still felt there is nothing worth to record today. I slept late yesterday, so I got up almost this afternoon. Read some tutorials of Canvas to think how to make the effect page flipping for ad injection. Then I just cooked for myself—simply fired rice. Finally ended the normal Sunday by watching Infinite Challenge.

Actually, I have much pressure on my work by the last week. I’m not sure if the leader or boss will ask me the process of the effect. I need to get up early tomorrow to make a good impression for those guys.
