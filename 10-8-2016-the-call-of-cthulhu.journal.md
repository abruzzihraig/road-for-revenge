### The Call Of Cthulhu
Sorry again, it is too late to write for me. I am so sleepy now.

I watched an old movie The Call Of Cthulhu tonight. It was made at 2005, but it was directed with old techniques as 1900. So the movie is black-white and silent.

I watched the movie just want to know the background of the game Bloodbourne. Each game from Hidetaka Miyazaki is extremely obscure, so we have to know more from the background, to know how Hidetaka Miyazaki thinks.

The movie actually looks a little bit boring. It just describes an archaeologist found some clues to confirm the cult was living, the god was existing, and anyone who knew that would be died. I think it might be the first time using recursive memories from different people on fiction. So maybe thatâ€™s why it is a classic to Hidetaka Miyazaki.

No matter what, Bloodbourne is another excellent game just like Darksouls. Let me live with my sorrow.
