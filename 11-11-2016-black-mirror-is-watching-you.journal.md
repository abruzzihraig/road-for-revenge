### Black Mirror Is Watching You
I cannot believe that I was learning the whole night. I read some technical articles, read some documents on MDN, and tried to solve some Katas on Codewars. How positive I am! Unexpectedly I didn't play games at the Friday night.

Before I did those boring but positive stuff, I watched the rest episodes of the Black Mirror I've not watched yet. And I have to say the Black Mirror is an incredible drama.

The last episode which impresses me a lot. It describes how we use AI in our future society, and how dangerous it is.

A company uses high technology to create a race of simulated bees. Tens of thousands bees just like the native bees to help flowers and plants be pollened. But a genius criminal hacked the bees then used them to attack somebody who was considered and selected by the internet users. If they dislike someone, they just vote and curse for him/her to die on a social app just like Twitter. The victim who gets the highest votes in one day will be killed by those bees.

The most shocking part is in the end, the bees killed all of the people who once has cursed someone on the network. It caused more than hundreds of thousands people die.

It is a kind of irony in our network society. Everyone hides behind the screen but exposes violence to someone. Public figures are always being attacked, and more and more of them are choosing to kill themselves. It is indeed the current social tragedy.
