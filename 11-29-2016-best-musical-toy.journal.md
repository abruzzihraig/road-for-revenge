### Best Musical Toy
I forgot time for playing my new musical toy Launchpad Pro. It is an incredible Live MIDI controller. It is not easy to learn, but it really hits me. I found some funny projects online could be performed on my Launchpad. Like all of the instruments, to perform a project better, you have to practice more. Thatâ€™s why I played it so late.

I have to go bed to sleep, to welcome the shitty requirements at tomorrow.
