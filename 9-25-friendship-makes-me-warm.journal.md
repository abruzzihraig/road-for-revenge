### Friendship Makes Me Warm
I wouldn’t  haven notified anyone today is my birthday. But since my friend Ryan asked me about some issues in his project, then I thought he should take his laptop and come to my home. So that I could fix those problems effectively.

So I just asked if he has free time on dinner, then maybe we could have a simple dinner for celebrating my birthday. And he answered yes.

He came to my home in the afternoon. We just took a little time on the issues he had met. After that, we both just chatted with each other, and waiting for his girlfriend Yifei to have a dinner.

However, when she came to my home, I was totally surprised that she bought some delicious food for us, and even a birthday cake!

That made me surprised but also made me in a spin. Cause there were lots of dishes still in sink need to be washed, I even didn’t have a pair of clean chopsticks for eating. That really makes me embarrassed. But I was really happy for got such the surprise.

We ate the spicy Korean food, the spicy fried chicken among them is best for me. But they both seemed cannot accept spicy food, and the beers. It made moved, because all of food they bought just be tried to satisfy my taste first. I have never seen such nice friends before.

After dinner, they put the birthday cake for me with the firing candles. Then they sang a birthday song for me sincerely. I was so enjoyable the birthday of my 25 years old.

I am so grateful today, it is the first time I could feel the friendship could make me out of those depression from work. Especially in the city which I lived without any familiar people.

Thanks for Ryan couples.
