### Holiday Ends
I had brunch this morning with my friends in Melbourne. The cafe is well-known for tourists so that we waited the queue nearly 1 hour. But finally the brunch was awesome, and especially the Mocha there satisfied me.

The Easter holiday finally ends. I have to come back to the office from tomorrow, but I wonâ€™t tell you we still have another holiday in the next week. This is one of points why I love this country.
