### A-Normal-Busy-Day-VIII
I did dozens of requirements for improving some user experiences on our website KDP. Since tomorrow is the final day for our front-end guys to handle code and ready to deploy. So there were lots of colleagues became product managers to criticize our work and put their unthoughtful opinions anytime. I am angry with that behavior by others. If you really care about our work, please put your opinions or ideas before nearing the day when we need to release the final project.

Felt tired in this small infighting company.
