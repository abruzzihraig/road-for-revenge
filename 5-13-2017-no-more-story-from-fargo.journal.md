### No More Story From Fargo
I should have written some code for figuring out the library Mobx-state-tree, but the third season of Fargo stole my mind again. However, this time, the story doesn’t satisfy me.

The third season seems that there is no story worth to tell, and most of its plots are separated by unrelated negligible matters around the main line. That makes the whole story messy and unreal, even though it claims the story is true.

I used to be a fan of the leading role Ewan McGregor a period. He was famous for the film Trainspotting he acts. But at this time, he doesn’t shine anymore to me. I can only find a boring and normal actor from his role. That makes me disappointed.

I nearly finished the half episodes in the current season, and I was hopeless about the half, but I’m not sure if the second half would take a turn for the better. Let‘s wait and see.
