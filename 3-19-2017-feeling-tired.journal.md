### Feeling Tired
I’m feeling tired about the relationship between my girlfriend and myself. I don’t know if we really could get married. Sometimes I suppose we would over, sometimes not. But I really feel tired about the conflicts between us. She never accepts my viewpoint, I never accept hers either. Maybe the best solution is we both leave.
