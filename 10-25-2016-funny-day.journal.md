### Funny Day
Sorry guys, I was involved in Dark Souls again. But the reason is not for the latest DLC. My friend got the Dark Souls 3 a few weeks ago. So at tonight, I just taught him some essential skills and gave him some useful weapons in the game.

Also, when we were connecting with each other, there were a few players as enemies invaded us. It was a funny process we killed every one who try to escape. I still remembered how hurt I used to when I suffered attacks from other guys. No one could help me then; even the general enemies helped those players to attack me together. Today, I finally could revenge for the players who always want to kill others.

I should have written more for the detailed how we fight with other players, but it is too late now. I have to sleep. Otherwise, I won't get up to take a shower tomorrow morning.

I'm not sure if I could play it with him tomorrow so that I won't make a flag today. The man is escaping now.
