### Rescue
My best friend sent me a message on the last night. The message was sent by 6:30 a.m., but it was recalled after awhile. He might think that I had already slept by then, but actually I didn’t. I just got a glimpse of the message as I was too sleepy then so I didn’t want to reply it immediately.

The message is about 20 lines. It basically tells how my friend treats death and life. I don’t remember the details in the message but it is totally negative. He said he finally found why people look forward to death and he wants to escape from life.

The message by the late at night made me sorrowed a whole day. I told our common friends what the situation I met, and we finally decided to have a big chat with the guy in the tomorrow evening. I don’t know how to rescue my friend. He makes me feeling powerless. Hope everything will be fine in the chatting of the tomorrow.
