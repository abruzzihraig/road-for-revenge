### Something Unexpected 
I just received the salary of this month, but I was surprised by that wage increase. It exceeds what I expected. It seems that I should work harder for my boss, but there was something embarrassing is that I refused a requirement from him recently. I would work on that requirement tomorrow morning as soon as possible.
