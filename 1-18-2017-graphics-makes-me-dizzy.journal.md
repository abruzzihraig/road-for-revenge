### Graphics Makes Me Dizzy
Thanks to my bro Dolphin. By his help, I finally understand the knowledge how does canvas effect on different resolutions. The problem has puzzled me a few years, but I have never been trying to figure it out. Whatever, it’s not too late. But it made me dizzy a while.

Like what I said before, I really feel sick with the graphics code. Even though I just used some basic mathematics I learned from my high school. It doesn’t mean it’s easy to write by coding. The code is more abstract than equation on paper. Also, you can draw some shapes on your draft, but you cannot write a comment that is easy to understand in code. Once you met any issue or bug, you have to stop everything before you understand what you did in the previous code. That really makes me discouraged.

In programming, you may need to be more careful on those edge conditions. Such as a divisor must not be zero, a slope could be infinite. You have to take care of every edge condition on your code to prevent those bugs which are hard to test.

Sometimes, you may take much time to maintain your logic, and the situations you write more, the complexity would be harder. Today, when I found my conditions were written in draw function became more and more complicated, I tried to recreate the basic mathematical model of these complicated parts. After two hours, all the things got done with a clear way. That is the hardest part for me–you won’t know what is the best way before you taste bitterness in graphics programming, and, the cost is expensive.

Otherwise, I’m not a genius, as well as I’m not good at math. So I can just keep admiring on those guys who really like to do awesome stuff with graphics by coding.
