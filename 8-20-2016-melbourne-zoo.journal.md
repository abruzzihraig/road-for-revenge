### Melbourne Zoo
This Saturday we went to the Melbourne zoo. Although the sky was blue, sometimes there still be slight rain. However, it didn’t appear a beautiful rainbow.

With my girlfriend Dog Xuan, we took the tram 55 which would end to West Coburg from the stop nearby our apartment. There were a few people on the route, nearly all of them would be going to the Melbourne zoo just like us.

After half an hour, we arrived at the gate of the zoo. The ticket price is $30 for per visitor. It is reasonable and valuable I suppose, because there are many staffs in the zoo take care of our safety, and the environment there. They also need to train some animals friendly. So that we could see those cute animals relaxing and happy.

From the entry gate, we got a small map on hand. The map just like a maze, there are a few different routes sometimes made us confused. We started with a rightward route, although it was opposite from most of visitors. Actually, we chose the rightward route just because it is closer to Koala and Kangaroo. They are the most famous animals in Australia. You won’t easy to see them in any other zoo especially in China.

Melbourne zoo is a Xanadu. Every place that a kind of animals lived is totally different. Some of them allow you contact with animals closely, you even can touch them, such as tortoise. Others you have to see via a window or fence. For example, you can only see all kinds of monkeys via a window, because they are sometimes dangerous.

There is a special corridor where grows lots of different trees. Various birds perched on them. We can’t recognise what name of any bird, but we really envied them. If I was a bird living in there, I will be indulged in the paradise.

We also saw a show from a seal, by its feeder. Yes, there still are some aquatic creatures in the zoo, just living in a specific aquarium.

After made a big circle route in the zoo, we finally took 2 hours to finish seeing most of cute animals. Since the map was so confusing, we still missed some lovely animals like big cats and tigers.

Have to say the Melbourne zoo is a recommended place if you’re in this city. It’s an absolutely paradise.
