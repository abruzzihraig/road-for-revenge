### Learning Day
Since the project has been deployed, so there is nothing need me to do today. I learned writing skills from “On Writing Well” a whole day. The author is the most prod old man I’ve never seen before. But he’s really cute, I can’t help to read more from his sentences.

But sorry guys, there is no time to write again. I promise that tomorrow I will write a journal once I got home.
