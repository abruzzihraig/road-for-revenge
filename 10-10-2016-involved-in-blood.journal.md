### Involved In Blood
I should have recorded something about new technologies or experiences on learning English.  Before I live here, I even thought I will have enough time to learn Haskell or to build an open-source project. But how ashamed I am, I can’t help to tell you guys the game Bloodbourne is holly incredible! I have never seen a better one before. Of course, excepting the Dark Souls 3.

Bloodbourne is just like the game Dark Souls 3. They all designed by the genius guy Hidetaka Miyazaki. The game has a similar art style with Dark Souls series. They are black, repressed, gothic and have an aesthetic violence. There is little word you can get from NPCs during the whole game, but you could reason each clue from the descriptions of props you got from the game. It’s obscure but it has more different understandings among all of the gamers.

It is an extremely difficult game as well, just like Dark Souls. But I cannot say which one is more difficult, cause they have different points on the difficulty. For example, in the Dark Souls 3, you could hold a shield to prevent damage on yourself, but there is no shield in Bloodbourne. However, you have more solutions and a faster speed of injection to revive your life in Bloodbourne. So you cannot simply judge which one is more difficult. But if you are a newbie, no matter which one you want to play, I suppose you will die a thousand of times before you become an expert.

Even though I know I am so decadent during the several months, but I have to say the game Bloodbourne is an extremely attractive game you shouldn’t miss that.
