### Narcos Season 2
I spent a whole day to watch the latest released drama Narcos season 2. I can’t help to recommend it to my friends. Because it is really brilliant as it based on a real-life event.

The Netflix could be the best drama platform. Even though I have a bad network in Melbourne, it still supports me a high-quality video. On the other hand, the Netflix has already released some popular dramas, such as Narcos, House of Cards, Making a murderer, etc. All of these dramas are very agreeable to me.

I am using the Netflix App on PlayStation for now. Cause I don’t have an Apple TV or a Chromecast yet. Actually, the version of PlayStation is good enough for me. It even has a traditional Chinese subtitle!

Most of conversations in this drama Narcos are Spanish. I am painful if I am listening to Spanish and watching to English subtitles. So the traditional Chinese is really helped me.

Just like the Game of Thrones, from the episode 1 - 5 are foreshadowings. After that, each part will make you astonished. You may feel amazing on how the event could be true. You won’t believe it could be happened in the real world. A drug dealer could have so many authorities, he could control everything in his country, it includes an amy and a government. No one can prevent him in that period.

I don’t want to expose too much content from it. But I really sure I was shocked by it. It has a compact story, and it’s ups and downs. Sometimes you need to hold your breath to watch it, because you don’t know who will be the next died person.

I really want to recommend it to you guys. Good night.
