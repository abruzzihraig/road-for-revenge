### Easter
I didn’t write diary yesterday due to I slept on bed and the lights were still lighting in the whole night.

From today, there is the second biggest holiday in Australia has become—the Easter. I don’t know what the holiday works, but I got four free days to play, and that is enough for me. I would like to play the new DLC in Dark Souls 3 tomorrow, and to buy some food for the long term.
