### In Circles

These days I felt so depressed, Because everyday I have to stand for stupid tasks from an authoritarian leader Kaveh, who is an bad Iranian.

I met so many people 24 years, I met so many colleagues after graduated. They all are kind-hearted man. Sure some people have strong personality in work, but they just focus on work rather than something else. But there are various kinds of strange things in the great world. I met a bad guy, a villain, a dictator and a lier.

Kaveh is the worst colleague I have ever seen before. He is a founder of Kakku.co, that means if could he can fire me at anytime.

But I just a newbie for the  strange city Melbourne. I have no friends here before, I have no family here before, but I just want to get a better way to implement my dream. So I stand here, I work here without any hesitate.

Working on a strange city always makes people feel lonely. I don’t miss family cause I don’t have a true family. I don’t miss friends cause I don’t want to stay the warm circle. I know there are something difficult I should through at this age. But I never thought it is a thing that making me restricted by a leader of villain.

How should I do? I guess no one would give me a specific answer. Some friends advised me that I should back to Beijing, Kakku as a  startup has unprofessonal technical team, as the leader is a bad guy. I know I can get a good job everywhere in China with my developing skills. But that is not my destination. So thanks my friend, we could drink but I can’t choose that.

I’m nearly 25 years old, that means I have to be responsible for my future life and family. My girlfriend is going to take the master program in Melbourne next year. That means no matter what I have to stay here and I can not be an irresponsible man.

I bet him could not see my journal on Github, even though he is a Software Engineer. That's one of reasons why I call him lier. If someday he saw it by someone who has ulterior motives, that’s it! And see you guys. Also I have to say fuck you villain I can not stand you anymore and I will expose every fake part of you for every colleagues along with our boss, then fuck you secondly I am quit from your bull-shit control.

If I got that step someday unfortunately, I have to find a new job within 30 or 90 days. That is a huge crisis for me. It means If I want to fuck the villain guy someday, I have to do more preparation to prevent a tragedy.

On the other hand, my boss has promised me that Kakku could give me a PR application after 2 years with working visa. That means the happy ending is standing this sucker 2 more years, maybe 2 and half years, then I got the PR, the next step for me is standing in front of him then speaking for everyone how the sucker has been a lier and a dictator.

2 years is not too long but still be limited. Especially for improving my English to find another job without PR. That is actual challenge for me to live here. Fucking and exposing him someday is for my dignity, Improving English is for my life.

That’s why I want to record a journey here: I want to force myself improving english everyday for preparing someday I could quit and I can say fuck you Kaveh.

I am working on a extremely unprofessional team so I have to learn something new everyday. Yes that makes me tired, but I have to do it, for my future, for my dream, and for my family.  So the road for revenge is just a my public plan that some people may find it at someday. It just includes two parts: one for improving english to make me communicated without any obstacle; anther for staying to learn important techniques everyday.  Nothing could change the plan, If someday I abandoned the promise before I quit the sucker's control, I will pay $100 for anyone who first find someday there is nothing to commit on my repo Revenge.

Do not laugh at my words today, I know it might have some issues, but I swear I can improve it better in every tomorrow night.

Why he is so bad and always made me angry everyday, let me tell you next time.
