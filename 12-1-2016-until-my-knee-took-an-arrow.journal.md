Until My Knee Took An Arrow
Don't know why my right knee was twisted yesterday. It's painful, and I cannot easy to go upstairs. I got the similar accident more than three times in the past year. I'm not sure if I have a problem with my knees. I should check it when I return to Beijing.

My father in law made a surgery these days, to cut a melanoma in his external auditory meatus. The surgical result is good, and the wound is small. For now, he is still lying on hospital bed, and there are some relatives nearby to accompany him. My girlfriend also visits him every day. Hope he could get well as soon as possible.

The disease is the worst thing during our life. To prevent if someday we got a critical illness, we'd better do exercise more frequently and do physical examination every year. Otherwise, no life to play will be the most woeful thing.
