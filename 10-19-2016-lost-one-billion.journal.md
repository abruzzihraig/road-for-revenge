### Lost One Billion
I am extremely down now. I felt sleepy, so I just decided to sleep a while after dinner. But when I got up, it was 11 p.m. I slept nearly 4 hours. To me, that is almost a whole day! It is similar to one billion!

I don't want to write anything today because I just want to save more time to play. Please forgive my sorrow. You will get the same feeling someday. Nothing worth to do but excellent games!
