### Surprising Holiday Melbourne Cup
There is good news that tomorrow is a holiday so I could stay at home to sleep a whole day. I never heard the festival before. It seems like a kind of game that horse race.

I don't have more anticipation on it. Just know tomorrow is a holiday is totally enough to me.

But we leave a whole day means that we only have four workdays this week. That would confuse my work plan, and I don't know whether we could release a deliverable version on Friday.

So the holiday makes me anxious more instead of feeling happy. The key point to me is how to persuade our professional UI designer to change his design simpler for our project. That will decide how much confidence we could have to make the new version released.

Since in these two days, no one wants to work. So I have to prepare enough significant opinions in advance. Hope we can trade it off to a better solution.
