### My Heart Flies As Holiday Comes
I have already equiped everything I need in my home for celebrating this “Otaku” holiday. My colleague Barry helped me delivered a desk from IKEA, and another colleague Xibo helped to lift the new TV on this new desk. With these guys’ generous help, I finally could enjoy the best cozy environment. I need to invite them to a meal tomorrow.

However, I am still confused how these heavy stuff are going to be transferred to a new home by my hand. Let me have a relaxing holiday and enjoy them first. And I bet my girlfriend will kill when she saw everything I bought these two months.

I can’t wait to celebrate the Christmas Day. Hope time flows speedily.
