### Hard To Be Self-discipline
I have already been decadent 3 days. Actually, I am anxious about that. There is a voice I could heard that it will ruin my life and my dream if I continue living like this.

I need to practise my English more, not just write a simple journal. I need to read some new technical news rather than to play PS4 everyday. I’ve been playing the Dark Souls more than 240 hours! How shame I am. I should have got a target if I used the 240 hours to anything.

I’m not sure if tomorrow I am still bad like these days. But I really wish anyone could warn me strictly. Cause the self-discipline make us better. If we can’t keep ourselves self-discipline, we should try to make a price to our friends for our promises. That might be another choice.
