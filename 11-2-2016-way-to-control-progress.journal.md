### Way To Control Progress
I met a problem today. Since we have already used the JIRA to control our project from two weeks ago, so that I don't need to make an extended plan for each month to get an overview of the whole project. Then I find there are some issues with the agile progress.

In JIRA, there are lots of issues, stories, and tasks are recorded in Backlog. We make every two weeks an active Sprint. The Sprint means a period that we need to release a deliverable version at the end of it.

When we don't have any tasks on To-DO list, we just need to pick up an issue or task from the Backlog. To get which one depends on how critical the issues are. Usually, we move the high-priority tasks from the Backlog.

Everything looks fine, isn't it? But I don't think so. I had been trying this way about two weeks then I found something important. One of the key questions is how can I arrange tasks averagely for an extended period. I don't want to take easy at the beginning, then find we don't have enough time in the last week to deliver our project before the deadline. If we found then, and we cannot finish the project even if we work overtime, we cannot face our clients.

When we use JIRA to pick tasks from Backlog to our TO-DO list, we just focus on how much time do we have to do a task. Then we only choose a task we think it is proper for our work time. However, you won't know how many tasks you need to implement and how much rest time do you have. That means you won't know whether you can deliver the final product in time for your clients.

That's what I worry. I think we still need a long-term plan for arranging how many tasks do we need to implement in every week. As the long-term plan, we may need to add more tasks to our TO-DO list. It will give us pressure to estimate how much work we should finish at each week. If we delayed something, we might need to work overtime to ensure the last week we can deliver the product. At the mean time, use this way we may be able to reject some low-priority requirements, and we could show the relevant evidence to other colleagues.

Just a little experience from my work. Ideally, we should combine a long-term plan and an agile way to control our development process. Wish anyone who has a better idea could discuss with me without any hesitance.
