### Love Needs To Be Learned
It’s a relaxing holiday Labour’s day. I implemented a part of my daily plan. But one thing I noticed made me feeling good, which is my girlfriend was learning something about how to love from books.

I have to admit that I have some faults on how I express love to my partner. However, I never tried to figure out those problems. Even though sometimes I think I am using a rational way to analyze any issues between us, I did not really care about how did she think. I predicate that she could learn how to solve those problems between us. That’s the only way to reduce arguments and keep harmony.

Love needs to be learned. If someday I have free time, I wish I could learn the same knowledge from that too.
