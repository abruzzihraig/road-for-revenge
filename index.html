            <p>This is the last day of the long public holiday. I played the game Uncharted 4 with my friend tonight. The survival mode of Uncharted 4 is extremely fantastic. We were too tense to hold controller effectively. But I have to say we were involved in the amazing online game.</p>
<p>It is too late now, I have to take a shower and go bed to sleep. Hope tomorrow we will get a cozy room in the office.</p>

            <p>I was invited to my friend Ryan’s home tonight. I took a board game Catan to his home to play after dinner.</p>
<p>Catan is the board game which I am really familiar. I can still remember its rules even though I haven’t played it more than one year. It’s also the first genuine board game I bought. I can pay less than 20% of the genuine board game in China, why not choose piracy? Since I have already in Australia, Surly I should buy a genuine one.</p>
<p>The genuine Catan has an elegant box with a few grooves which have different shapes could be filled with those cards and props. When you put the cards together on your table, you will get a smooth and flat map. But in piracy, you will be bothered with the rugged map.</p>
<p>I used to call myself Catan Yang because I always win the most rounds of Catan I played in the past. I don’t know why but the result indeed indicates that I have high winning percentage on this game, I guess that might be 80 percent or higher. Just like there is a God of Catan always protects me when I develop my territory.</p>
<p>Just like what I said that I have high winning percentage on this game. We played two rounds tonight, and each round might take 90 minutes. Even though I suffered many obstructions, finally I won all of them. And the result protected the title again.</p>
<p>I have to say play board games are the best way to make friends closer. I will buy another famous strategy board game “Puerto Rico” when it is in store.</p>

I just want to transfer my focus on something else to forget the quarrel. And also I won’t give her an apology about my rude words. That’s my final self-esteem. Hope her could forget that too.</p>

            <p>Let me celebrate my first Christmas holiday. It is going to become from tomorrow. Even though I have no plan on holiday, I still feel happy with that—I do not need to see some guys during these two weeks.</p>
<p>My boss invited us to have a brunch this morning. We chose a Korean restaurant and ate from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. It’s nearly a whole workday. We just worked less than half hours after we went back to the office, and left early.</p>
<p>Melbourne is Paradise! No one wants to work today. Let’s enjoy life.</p>

            <p>I just turned to play the game Helldivers again. Since the game Magicka2 made my friends and me excited online. So we decided to play the similar best online game Helldivers on PS4 in 2015.</p>
<p>My account has only eight levels, and my friend is totally a newbie. We were fucked by those zergs again and again. Even though sometimes there was a high-level guy could help us out of danger, finally we would pull up his/her socks to make tasks failed. No wonder no one wanted to fight with us more than one battle.</p>
<p>We liked to choose challenging battles, but the high-level enemies always taught us how to be human. We were killed by some giant zergs thousands of times, but we didn’t give up. I don’t mean if we insist on fighting with those powerful enemies more times then we could get a victory. We just never give up, but always keep died.</p>
<p>No matter what, it’s a funny game. We will play it tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I have already equiped everything I need in my home for celebrating this “Otaku” holiday. My colleague Barry helped me delivered a desk from IKEA, and another colleague Xibo helped to lift the new TV on this new desk. With these guys’ generous help, I finally could enjoy the best cozy environment. I need to invite them to a meal tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, I am still confused how these heavy stuff are going to be transferred to a new home by my hand. Let me have a relaxing holiday and enjoy them first. And I bet my girlfriend will kill when she saw everything I bought these two months.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to celebrate the Christmas Day. Hope time flows speedily.</p>
