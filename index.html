            <p>I was tired of anything happened around myself. I cannot focus on my work since the event that breaking up with my girlfriend hit me. I need more time to adapt the life without her.</p>
<p>There is sad news. My colleague Justin hasn’t come to the office more than two weeks, whose mother got cancer and passed away these days so that we will go to his mother’s funeral tomorrow morning. I hope he could be strong and still be happy as his mother never leave him.</p>
<p>It’s a sad season with the continuous rain.</p>

            <p>Finally, I lost the girl. With peeling each of the photos that were stuck on walls, the memory about her was disappearing. The only one thing won’t change—the girl has the most beautiful smile in the world, which comes from heaven.</p>
<p>Would you know my name, if I saw you in heaven? I must be strong and carry on, because I know I don’t belong here in heaven. I might be lonesome again, but I have to go. Make everything in mind being smoke.</p>

            <p>I used to describe my leader’s mood by the weather of Melbourne. The weather in Melbourne is such mutable that you cannot guess what the weather would change at the next second. Like today, the sunshine was still shining, but suddenly the rain came. You can look through golden sun from the rain falls, which is an amazing miracle.</p>
<p>I would have bought new shoes this afternoon, but the rain blocked my plan. My ex-colleagues will come to Melbourne tomorrow, so I need to take them to enjoy this city. But I don’t have a pair of comfortable shoes because I just wear flip flops a few months.</p>
<p>Look my mustache and my flip flops. You cannot imagine how lazy I have been becoming. It seems there would be a long-time test on my physical strength in tomorrow. I really want to skip tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I didn’t get your reply and I have seen the dev team rules from Kaveh’s email. I am calm to say the office doesn’t need me anymore. I think I can’t save the dev team. But I hope you could find a better guy than me. Maybe even you pay such guy two times of my salary, he wouldn’t join. Because there is a cheater engineer wants to control everything in his hand just by his mutable mood.</p>
<p>Again, don’t trust those shit words that emphasize PERMISSION or SECURITY. I can find one hundred ways to attack those shit projects. The man who wants to control everything is actually the most unprofessional guy in SECURITY. So I cannot serve such liar anymore. Please let me quit, then let himself enjoy his empire.</p>
<p>I don’t want to lose myself just for the PR to be a member of the country. I don’t want to waste my intelligence on such hard work and a liar ARCHITECTOR, which is the worst joke during my whole life.</p>
<p>My girlfriend put a request that breaks us up just now because she cannot leave her parents. And I ask myself, why I am here to be a slave of a man that I really dislike. Will I make my life better or my career higher? I am losing everything even my family. If you enjoy it, please enjoy it continuously. I don’t want to waste my life for playing with such a shiftless dictator.</p>
<p>thanks,<br>Yang</p>

            <p>I was playing Dark Souls with one of my friends at tonight. We spent much time on kinds of traps from Hidetaka. We were killed by giants treading, or by mouses sieging. Anyway, we always die before we get the boss in that chapter. But the joy was being there, around the enemies and traps. To break through the dilemma is the essence of Dark Souls.</p>

            <p>I watched a brilliant horrible Korea movie at tonight. The movie named The Wailing. It describes a horrible story happened in a small village. It has a long time about 2 and half hours, but even though you watch it seriously until 2 and quarter, you wouldn’t know who is the final murderer.</p>
<p>For figuring out what does the director really wants to tell us, I even took more than 1 hour to read some file reviews. And I have to say it is actually a complicated story. If you want to understand it, you have to learn much of knowledge about religions. No matter what the religion knowledge you know, the movie itself is still worth to watch. If you want to find any horrible but intelligent movie, you could try this one. Korea movie is always best.</p>
