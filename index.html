<p>I announce that I have protected the Uncle’s smile again. But I won’t speak the company’s name due to my girlfriend is watching me in somewhere.</p>
<p>Also, I finally got the discount of the Novation Launchpad Pro. I wrote it before in my diary. It is an attractive toy to me, and I feel so happy to got 30% discount on it.</p>
<p>Forget the meaningful stuff I should have worked. Let me die within the enjoyable life. I will bear more critiques as I just write the inability of myself on the dozens of journals.</p>
<p>But Uncle is still keeping his smile and waving his hand for me. I’ve become a devout believer.</p>

            <p>Every day, I feel full of passion to work, and I always set a promise for myself during walking to the office. I said to myself at tonight I should write some code for my fancy stuff. And I even think about the structure of my personal project every morning. But once I got home, I wouldn’t  want to do anything about coding. I don’t know why I am so resisted to work on my personal stuff. I mean programming is always attractive to me, I feel enjoyable when coding. However, I just do not want to write code in the evening. I know that is harmful to my life, but I still cannot get rid of it.</p>
<p>More than three months I have not written my image editor. And I feel it worse as time flies, the feeling is terrible to me. There is nothing significant on my Github, and I even do not want to tell anyone my account, because I feel shameful, there is nothing worth to show. I have pursuit and taste, and I really want to make craft high-quality and elegant. But I always let myself down.</p>
<p>No one can save myself until I break it up. Hope someday I could continue to work on my image editor, there will be a bunch of stuff need to refactor. I don’t care about if anyone will use it. But that is an artwork to myself, and it is a promise as well. Get away from the white shadows.</p>

            <p>‘Safari is another Internet Explorer’ is not a joke. I paid a whole day for a weird issue on iOS Safari. And now I still don’t have any clue on it. I almost get insane.</p>
<p>The issue mainly occurs on my Boss’s iPhone 6 Plus. When use his iPhone 6 Plus to access my website, and fetched an artwork list then try to open one of them with the image editor, the website will break and reload suddenly. It initially didn’t show on my iPhone 6S. I guessed that’s because my iPhone 6S has a more powerful hardware than iPhone 6 Plus, and maybe the iPhone 6 Plus breaks due to lack of RAM.</p>
<p>However, I borrowed iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C from other colleagues to try to test the issue, and they both didn’t get crashed unexpectedly. The result totally confused me: Why the iPhone 6 Plus will break more frequently but iPhone 5 won’t?</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, iPhone 6 Plus will break almost every time. But that doesn’t mean the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 6s won’t crash. They just occur the issue with a lower frequency.</p>
<p>The most complicated problem is that the issue occurs randomly. When I fetch more than 100 artworks data(each item only includes some necessary data), all devices will have a high frequency to crash. The iPhone 6S is relatively safe.</p>
<p>When I try to fetch 20 artworks data, the device iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPhone 6S won’t break except for the iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>When I try to get only five artworks, all of them will be fine. Of course, it is a relative ‘fine.’ There is no way to prevent the crashing entirely.</p>
<p>Don’t think the weird issue just occurs in the process when fetching artwork data. When we try to fetch 20 artworks and every device looks fine, then pick up one of them and open it with the Image Editor, you will see the iPhone 6 Plus will totally break. As for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C will have a medium frequency to crash. Only iPhone 6S will live longer.</p>
<p>In Chinese, we call the issue bug of mystery. I know when open image editor, it will load a JSON object with a base64 dataUrl, it will occupy more memory in a browser. Most of the time the iPhone 6 Plus crashes on this step. After edited the final artwork and ready to save and close the image editor, the image editor will export dataUrl from the canvas. And that would be another memory-waste operation. It will make some iPhones crashed as well.</p>
<p>It sounds like the memory runs out, right? But after my friend Dolphin helped me to reduce the memory usage with Blob object and window.URL instead of base64 dataUrl. The crash issue still occurs randomly. I even want to buy my boss another new iPhone. Why does the fucking Safari on iPhone 6 Plus have such thorny problem? Why doesn’t Apple care about its shit? I nearly took seventy percent of the time to find and to fix the issues on Safari in this project.</p>
<p>Am I wrong to make the content rich? Why you Apple with your shitty Safari always obstructs we front-end guys to build a website better? Why you always have so many issues on your platform and turn a blind eye on it?</p>
<p>I will witness you collapse at someday.</p>

            <p>My friend Dolphin analyzed my journals and found the keyword ‘game’ comes more than 50 times(But actually it just exists in 30 articles). No matter what it makes me awkward. Then I did the same thing and found more than 20 articles related to Dark Souls. Known that made me feel innocent, because the DarkSouls series(includes Bloodborne) are entirely arts, and Hidetaka Miyazaki is the best genius in video game creating. I don’t mind if I will pay more than three hundred hours on each game from him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I really want to do some significant stuff for myself. Because I don’t want someday when I become old will be test human nature from family or society then, I don’t want to see the scenario just due to lack of money. Hope everyone I met will keep kindness forever. Hope each friend I met will not become a man/woman like a scheming questioner in Zhihu. I’ve already seen much sorrow in the first half of my life.</p>
<p>Nearly night, a friend asked me why I choose GNU Gettext to handle internationalization on the web rather than a typical dictionary solution. I thought a little and answered to him that GNU Gettext has three advantages than a dictionary. They are context, plural, and interpolation. I thought my reply is the key point to explain another similar question why we will choose GNU Gettext.</p>
<p>I know you can make a dictionary better and add some useful features to your personal solution, and it even might be better than GNU Gettext. But the GNU Gettext is just a standard. It thinks more than a regular developer. The difference is just like why we choose to use OAuth.</p>
<p>The GNU Gettext supports context, which means you can control every word you want to translate in an accurate context. For example, the same word in English could have a different meaning in other languages, so that the same English word displayed on different pages may need to translate to a different word in other languages.</p>
<p>The ‘plural’ question has a little bit of like the context above. Some languages are sensitive with singular and plural. For example, in English, we use the form ‘one day’ but ‘two days.’ However, in Chinese, they are same with ‘N 天’.</p>
<p>As for the interpolation, you might have already guessed what does the Gettext do. Different languages may have different grammar, and the various grammar form could have different structure and order in one sentence. So in GNU Gettext you could use a sentence with interpolation as a key of the original dictionary, it usually is English dictionary. Especially when you write something like <code>Hello %name%</code> in English, but you want to change the structure in Chinese like <code>%name%, 你好</code>.</p>
<p>Another benefit from GNU Gettext is there are lots of PO editors you could use for editing different language dictionaries.</p>
<p>That’s why I recommend developers to use the standard GNU Gettext to handle internationalization rather than recreate another solution by themselves with some traps.</p>
<p>Time to sleep, Good night!</p>

            <p>It’s just a gaming day, and nothing needs to record as before. I played the Dark Souls 3 a whole night with my friend Chong. We got through a maze and tried to fight with multiple intruders, but we all died.</p>
<p>I started to search some compelling dramas again due to the boring weekend. I should have been going to barbecue with my friends tomorrow, but since they invited so many new guys that I didn’t familiar, so I declined them politely. Maybe we could have a board game when we don’t need to invite so many people.  After all, the scenario of many people always makes me feel awkward.</p>
<p>Give tomorrow another relaxing expectation, and hope the time flows slowly.</p>

            <p>Watched some TV shows, played the latest game Dishonored 2. I‘ve been relaxing at the whole night. But I don’t have anything want to write today.</p>
<p>The Dishonored2 is not excellent like what I expected before. I even cannot stay interested in it more than one hour. I suppose maybe I don’t belong to the gamers who like to play as a spy or an assassin. Maybe the DarkSouls3 and the Bloodborne raised my taste on those ACT/RPG games. I don’t have any interest in a simple game which doesn’t have any punishment when you fail or die.</p>
<p>No matter what I am going to enjoy the weekend. I could sleep until tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>I wrote a piece of email to my boss to answer his question about a bug. Since I was earnest about it, so I just want to migrate it to my today’s diary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Yee,</p>
<p>This afternoon I tried to use English to explain why the video injection doesn’t show on some websites. And I know you are totally confused with my poor English spoken, I feel so sorry, and that makes me feel uncomfortable. Even though it is hard to explain even use Chinese, I still want to explain it again to you, and it is also a practice to me that using English to answer a complicated question.</p>
<p>During 2013 - 2015, most of the popular front-end technical architectures are based on ‘Multiple Pages Website.’ It is a traditional technical solution to build a website. Even today, there are still millions of websites are using multiple pages. Such as those we found that didn’t show our injected video ads.</p>
<p>We all know front-end project needs to optimize its performance. In general, it is about code compression, code combination and a series of related tasks we call them build flow. You will find that in a ‘Single Page Application’ we usually only have one final javascript file. Even though it might be large, we only need load the file once during users access the app(SPA).</p>
<p>However, multiple pages website cannot do the same way. That’s because each page we want to redirect will reload all scripts again. That’s one of the reasons why a multiple-page website will load scripts separately.</p>
<p>Another important reason is that in software architecture, the best practice to maintain a large project is dicing the code to different bulks. We call the bulks Modules. A module could be separated by business logic, object-oriented design, and a particular architecture(e.g. we use Component Architecture in KDP). So that for a front-end project, there are dozens/hundreds of modules under the hood. In SPA, they could be combined to a final script. As for multiple-page websites, they don’t have the similar condition to use the same way, so they have to load multiple scripts in every page of themselves.</p>
<p>Then the Question comes, if they have to load multiple scripts, how could they solve so many critical problems like circular dependency, lazy load, and concurrency order.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, Javascript Communities published more than three Modular Standards during 2013 - 2015. They are AMD, CMD, and CommonJS. They all are similar Modular Standard and have been implemented by a bunch of Module Loader libraries.</p>
<p>So the multiple-page websites we can see, they might use any of Modular Standards. If a multiple-page website doesn’t use any modular architecture, it would be an incredible nightmare.</p>
<p>These content above are necessary knowledge to know our issue about why there are some websites didn’t show the Video Ads.</p>
<p>Except for the part of websites that didn’t show the Video Ads just because of bad network. Other websites all use AMD modular standard.</p>
<p>In our Injection code, we modified a famous 3rd-party library called Hammar.js and imported it to our code. The Hammar.js supports AMD/CMD/CommonJS and a global object(refer to ‘window’ in browsers environment).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the guy who wrote the shitty code didn’t know anything about the Modular Standard. He changed the Hammar.js, but he didn’t implement the module of AMD/CMD/CommonJS. That means he just stuck everything into a global object(window). It is an amateurish way, and it has been proved dangerous code by communities.</p>
<p>The code of Video Ads uses the Hammer.js. That’s why we cannot see Video Ads on some websites which are using AMD standard. When we access them, the Hammar.js will find the current website is using AMD, but our code doesn’t implement the related module. So our code cannot find anything from the undefined/empty module. Then it breaks without any error.</p>
<p>At the mean time, I was shocked with there is no any code to throw or catch the related error, that’s why we cannot easy to find the reason. Also, another shocking thing is our injection code will repeatedly be invoked every 25 ms if the bug is triggered! Only primary school student could write code like that.</p>
<p>I saw the code and feel there are many bugs will come in the future. And we will waste our time and difficult to find those bugs again and again. To fix bugs on it is even harder than rewrite a new one, it also will take more time. Quality takes some time. Right architecture takes some time. Project workflow takes some time. But all of them won’t take us dive into hell at someday when we meet issues. So don’t be short-sighted and don’t think the shitty code works well. This terrible thought will take a technical company to die, and it also shouldn’t be spoken from a real software engineer.</p>
<p>thanks,<br>Yang</p>
