### VR Is The Future
Some guys might already know that I’ve finally got the PS VR today. I tried it with a bunch of games, apps, and movies until 3 a.m. It really shocked me.

Since I don’t have time tonight, so I will write my experience on PS VR tomorrow. I also want to tell you guys which points really shocked me and which parts are terrible to me. Then maybe you will have a significant reference.
