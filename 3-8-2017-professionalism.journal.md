### Professionalism
I read an article from my ex-boss, the article which is posted today and is shared by all his employers. I have to say I don’t need to flatter him but he is actually a wise man. You can learn a lot from his words.

From the article he posted today, you could learn how a company overcomes the winter. I also looked through his articles from history, and I found something interesting about professionalism. He said that being professional will help you be confident about everything you will meet. Then you don’t need to care whatever petal small profit. You will get a large world.

I think so. I met so many people who think they got a necked bottle in their profession, and they were thinking about whether they need to turn to another industry. I said no, I don’t think they really got the neck bottle if they had tried their best to be professionals. For example, if you are an engineer, are you really good at English? Do you really care about something under the hood? Do you subscribe and read the news in your domain every day? Have you really paid attention to whatever you used in your project? Even the tools or editor you used? If not, you just never wanted to be a professional. That’s why you always thinks that you feel boring on your work.

Even to be a cleaner, you still have lots of things to think and to learn. You could pay your whole life on how to improve your professionalism. That’s the only way to happy in your work.
