### Beijing As It Does
I took more than 15 hours on the flight from Melbourne to Beijing and finally got my girlfriend’s home. So I missed the journal yesterday. Also, I found that during this holiday I won’t have so much time to write journals as I want to pay more time with my friends and families. So the journal plan would be frozen until I come to Melbourne.

Thanks for each guy who was staring at my journals.
