### 80 Points
We got some stage victories today. That is we have released the first version of KDP publisher portal. It should have a celebration in the evening, but we guys were tired, and we just wanted to back to home, to sleep or to play games.

I finally got a rest tonight. The Dark Souls makes me relaxing at home. I don’t know if there are still some busy workdays are waiting for me this month. But I just want to make a rest at this weekend. I just want to play games, and have a good sleep.

The first version has good responses by our colleagues, I think so. Cause I took so much time on it these days, and I swear I have already tried my best on it. 

Actually, I was worried about if our colleagues actually know what we did. So I wrote a detailed change logs on the first version. Hope everyone could know what is the actual front-end project and what is the professional engineering way. And hope our boss could know how long we need to develop a professional front-end website.

The worry seems like that if a child got 100 points, he/she will be considered an excellent guy. If a child got 60 points, he/she will be considered an eligible guy. But if a child take some efforts then get 80 or 90 points, most of people still suppose the guy is eligible. Even though the child has already tried his/her best on it.

My colleagues always told me they don’t need a good work, they don’t need any beautiful code, If a customer said it doesn’t need change, we don’t need to do anything. So that I don’t need so much time on work. That is what I really hate. I don’t want to make myself stoop, even if in this relaxing country. I believe someday I finally could find some guys who have the same intentions with me, then we could build some actually valuable and significant arts for our life and for the world.

That’s all, let me play in the whole night!
