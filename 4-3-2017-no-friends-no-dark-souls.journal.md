### No Friends No Dark Souls
I was playing Dark Souls with one of my friends at tonight. We spent much time on kinds of traps from Hidetaka. We were killed by giants treading, or by mouses sieging. Anyway, we always die before we get the boss in that chapter. But the joy was being there, around the enemies and traps. To break through the dilemma is the essence of Dark Souls.
