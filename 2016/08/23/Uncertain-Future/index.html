        <!-- Post Content -->
        <p>After bearing an ignorant leader again and again. Today, I finally broke out my anger to my boss.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, my colleague Xibo told me our leader assigned a new task to him. The task is about creating a front-end project for our new advertisement distribution system. Our leader let Xibo to create a basic structure and workflow for this new system. Although I don’t think the leader know what is the front-end workflow as his unprofessional technical knowledges.</p>
<p>I was unpleasant for the silly decision. Because I don’t know why no one told me anything about such so important new system. We don’t know what is the deadline and what is the original requirements. If Xibo didn’t tell me the new task he had been assigned, I will get angry after two weeks later when I finished my current work then joining his new project. That’s because Xibo as a newbie of front-end developer, he doesn’t have so many relative knowledges and experiences to hold the basic structure. I cannot understand why the leader doesn’t choose me to discuss how to implement such an important front-end project. Does he think he knows everything on web techniques? Or does he suppose the new system is easy? I just don’t want to expose how bad he as a software engineer to the whole company for now.</p>
<p>And, he even think he is a technical architect. What an incredible joke! Is there doesn’t have any software engineer in Australia? I can’t believe how he could cheat so many kind colleagues such long time. With his unprofessional and unrestrained structure ideas, the company Kakku would be died soon or later.</p>
<p>The leader is always make me restricted. I have so much passion to here to help our team get a better front-end technical environment, but he treat me like a cleaner. I cannot know what is the customer’s requirements. I cannot know what is the deadline to delivery a product. I even cannot control the specific technical solution on front-end. He is so irresponsive to hold everyone to make a product like a shit.</p>
<p>Yes, he is using JIRA to manage the progress of all of projects. But use the JIRA like what he did, I’d rather use a note to manage it. Because in JIRA, no one has any authority to write a new task for themselves. He as a dictator has all of authorities to control everything, but he just assigned a cursory task for everyone. A task may take 1 or 2 weeks. Is that a task for project? No, that is a useless shit for his lazy and dictating personal interest.</p>
<p>I am here just for working for my boss Yee, If I want to do every better thing for Kakku but restricted by the leader. I’d rather go back to China.</p>
<p>So I went to the boss’s office with Xibo after got off work. I showed him my attitude, which I don’t want to be controled by such the leader. If the new project is urgent, we would rather take overtime on work with a right and professional way. I cannot accept his any unprofessional advice on our work. He doesn’t have any competence to dictate his wrong technical orders on us.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Yee will tell the leader tomorrow morning. I hope it is useful. If not, maybe I have to quit at someday I cannot bear the lier anymore.</p>
<p>Hope Kakku is better, and hope my work is valuable in the future.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>
