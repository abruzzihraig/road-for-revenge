        <p>Maybe today is the day I spoke most. Nearly the whole day from morning to evening I was talking. Because I need to figure out all of the requirements and the interactions from the product, which is our next project KDP.</p>
<p>That is a successful step as the beginning of the KDP. All I need is just to build everything professional with my experiences. Even if we have to take over time to work to guarantee the product could be released at the precise delivery deadline.</p>
<p>In this morning, there was a conversation for all of the team members. But it just like the leader wanted to complain something like a child. It sounds like: “Come on guys, yesterday such both guys accused me to our boss, and they want to get authorities for themselves. How would you think it? Please choose and stand in line.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why a guy R speak on behalf for the leader so much. Maybe they are always in the same boat. They might be cannot catch our three Chinese guys in techniques. But they want to keep their position and stay lazy and cheap. Because they don’t want to change anything, they just enjoy their current relaxing shitty work.</p>
<p>How hard I was fighting for the basic workflow. It should be easy originally. I just want to take a code review for a week on the colleague Xibo’s code. Only him need to be reviewed, and only one week we need to do this way. But the leader always limited us do it. I don’t know how many times I begged for the leader. I said I could create a private repository on Github, we both just need it to review code during one week, after that, we will transfer the repo totally to Amazon CodeCommit.</p>
<p>But the man always says you can’t do that. “Can we integrate a code review tool on JIRA? ” Or “can we switch to use Bitbucket?”. The similar things usually cheesed me. Because I know Github, Xibo knows Github, and only we both will develop the project KDP. Why have we to learn such complicated things from the leader’s advice? We just want to do code review a few times! Do not control us with his babyish technical knowledge ok? If he doesn’t know Git, that’s fine we don’t care, because we don’t need write code with him on front-end project. If he doesn’t know how to build a private git dashboard distribution, that’s fine, and there are two Chinese guys know how to host the system on our internal server. If you know nothing, but you still want to reject any reasonable advice, finally you want to give us some useless recommended technical solutions, but you never used before. Why hire me to here? I am not the worker for your all shitty tasks. If you want to prevent me work for a product better, just let me quit. I don’t want to be with you on those annoying things.</p>
<p>I don’t know why such a small startup has so many harmful factors. Someone wants to protect own interests. I don’t know what does it meaningful when you have so many titles like Software Architect, Product Manager, Project Manager, and Founder just on such a small company? There were just two developers before!</p>
<p>If you feel happy to reject me again and again, and always let me do some shitty things. I could quit anytime without any pressure.</p>
<p>Whatever we finally secure the right is that we bought an enterprise account from Github. That means we could use Github now to do something professional, that is an essential step to make procedure and product better.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to find all of the questions about the latest design with Xibo. We summarized many confusing issues for interactions and business logics. Then we asked for our designer and the leader more than 2 hours to figure out all of the things.</p>
<p>The deadline is close, but hope we could confirm something! If we did it better than before, then we still suffer the same bad things, I will quit without hesitation.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>
