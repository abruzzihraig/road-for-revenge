        <p>Apple makes me anxious with their new released MacBook Pro. I cannot easy to choose one for my girlfriend to do artwork. And also, Microsoft released the excellent product Surface Studio, which makes me realized Apple is becoming worse every year.</p>
<p>We have been waiting for the new MacBook Pro more than three years. I don’t know how many guys just like me we are always waiting for the new product to upgrade our old one.</p>
<p>But how can we accept that? A laptop for ‘professional’ users but it doesn’t have an ESCAPE key? How can I code without that key? Especially, I am a VIM user.</p>
<p>Additional, I don’t think the silly touch bar is efficient for our professional users, such as designers, programmers, and music makers. We don’t want to switch our sight between keyboard and screen. And we also don’t need to control our work between the solid keyboard and the virtual keyboard. I suppose the virtual keyboard is only invented for the eldest people or the people who cannot type without looking their keyboard.</p>
<p>And the four USB-C ports are the worst feature on the new version to me. I cannot imagine how many lines I need to buy, and how many lines I need to take with the MacBook outside. If someday I find I don’t have a proper line at home, I have to go outside and to buy a conversion line. Or to choose to buy one online but need to wait a few days. How ineffective it is! Is that truly produced for professional users?</p>
<p>My girlfriend will be a designer, so I just want to pick up a decent machine for her. However, now I am totally confused. I don’t want to pay so much for the terrible MacBook. It is too expensive for its wrong changes.</p>
<p>Surface Studio might be a right choice. But I extremely dislike Windows operation system. It just likes junk to me. You cannot imagine how ugly it is when it renders text on the 5k screen. And also I don’t want to use two different environments in my home. That means for everything I have to control with two accounts and two different configs.</p>
<p>How about iMac? It should have been a good choice. But please note it uses 5k display but has a mediocre graphics. I don’t want to see the bad performance during animation at the next version of MacOS.</p>
<p>We all know VR is becoming more and more popular. Most of the best VR products are only supported by Windows. That means if you want to try any of them, you have to get a Windows computer. So it seems like choosing the Surface Studio would be better. Even though all the choices are totally shit to me. I even want to give them up all.</p>
<p>Does anyone have the same feeling on the shitty choice? Apple makes me disappointing again. I cannot figure out the best solution for making our studio cozy. We want to code, we want to design, and we want to play games without any other complicated upset.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>
