        <p>As what I expected yesterday, the warden brought a heap of unreasonable ideas to us. He tried to force us to follow everything from his mind, but only one thing you could get from him is that you cannot imagine how arrogant a man could be.</p>
<p>We three Chinese guys argued with him a whole afternoon. Even though he didn’t have any valuable argument, he still wasted our time by his quibble.</p>
<p>He wants to split we front-end guys to different projects—as he just wants to make every project has a person who is totally responsible for the project itself. So that if our boss asks us a specific problem on any projects, then the warden can just easy to put the issue to someone.</p>
<p>That means if there is an issue, someone must be guilty.</p>
<p>That also means we cannot do the part of what we are good at in a project. Each front-end developer must implement all features throughout a whole project, whatever the build workflow, library choose, code style, basic structure, fancy component, you name it. It is absolutely ineffective for us—only two front-end developers—and one is a newbie.</p>
<p>If there is a project which is totally written by one person that might work with his silly idea. But all projects in our company are written by a team. How could make one person totally understand every detail in the project by others? That is impossible. What if one developer has to maintain and change some code on the work by others? He/She may be able to implement the changes, but there might be side effects around there as well. Someday when the original code author found the reason of the side effects, the author may have to rewrite the code which changed by the previous maintainer.</p>
<p>Such an ineffective strategy. You cannot believe that it comes from a man who called himself a software architect. Doesn’t he feel shameful? This is a small company which only have five developers in it. If I have to work with somebody like him, I’d rather drink poison. But I don’t have any choice due to I am still in the jail.</p>
<p>I cannot get the personality which is arrogant and ignorant from some nations, but wish I can get rid of those nations in my future work.</p>
<p>Another thing is if we split our front-end team, which indicates one developer could do everything from top to bottom. That also means I could be fired painless anytime by the warden when he feels unhappy with me.</p>
<p>That’s it, the new life in jail has come again.</p>
<p><em>Pls comment on the relative Issue of this journal on my Github, any advice would be appreciated!</em></p>
