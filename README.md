## Why I have to find the way to live

Guess any smart guy who has a little bit knowledges about #@$ could find the road to heaven.

Story continues...

That is it.

## Review Bonus

My friends checked my journals then helped me finding some issues. I suppose that would be better than just writing by myself.

So I decide to give some bonus to people who are kindhearted to help me review the articles.

It is a temprory bonus plan below(1 week), I'm not a rich man but I think it is resonable. If someday I find the scheme need to improve, I'll change it on next stage during the road.
