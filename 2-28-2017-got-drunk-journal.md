### Got Drunk
We had a dinner with our clients from Japan in this evening. And I don’t cost them so much, only one cup of beer just made me drunk. I tasted a kind of weird pasta that is made by squid with its ink. I’m not sure if my shit will be black, let us expect that wonderful imagination.

I really admire those Japanese guys, they all have good English skills just like their mother tongue. I know they speak Japanese in Japan everyday, but I don’t know why they could speak English so fluently when they left there. They pushed us have to get in office early these days, that really hit me. I felt sleepy the whole day and kept stammering on everything what I talked to others.

I want to sleep more. Hope you Japanese guys could leave and find other beautiful place then enjoy your remaining journey. Don’t be in the office, please.
