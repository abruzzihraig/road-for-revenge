### Drama Day
My belly was destroyed by my cooked food again. Why I always make food with so much chili sauce? My stomach is screaming now.

I was laying in bed a whole day and watching dramas. This month is a drama month. Most American dramas I favor are released from this month. I just watched the latest seasons of Silicon Valley, Better Call Saul, and Prison Break. The next attempt for me is Fargo. I found it has a high score in Douban. Hope it could satisfy me.
