### Admire Once Or Never
I don't know how to help my girlfriend to overcome her poor English. She never listened to me on those essential things which would lead us to a better situation. If she failed on the IELTS test again, she might not be able to come to me.

I don't know why I persuaded her one year before that she should become to prepare her English for the IELTS test. She always gives me an annoying reason for those insignificant things. I told her do not escape from the hard but essential things. However, she never cared about them until she got failed recently.

These days she stayed at home but didn't see or listen to anything about English. Just slept more than twelve hours every day but did nothing. And she told me that she has lots of important things need to do every afternoon except her English.

How can I save you, my girlfriend? You always drop out your opportunity to make yourself in crisis. You know you are not a smart girl but why don't you make an effort for those important things and be responsible for your future life? I am so disappointed when you hung up my call as I criticized you. If you really care about that, why you cannot pass those things? Are they really cannot be touched by your efforts?

I don't want to lose hope on you again and again and all over again. This is not a difficult thing that to choose and to solve the most critical thing on the way to future. I won't back to China due to your stupid choice. You can escape from every hard work, but please at least just let me admire you once. I don't want to live like a loser all the time. I don't want to see my friend or my girlfriend to be always a loser too. Why cannot just overcome such a simple challenge for the future? I am not your parents who could protect you all the time. If you failed on something, you could return to your family, but I cannot. That's the most primary difference between we both. If you don't like that and think the pressure from me is too heavy for you, Just tell me you cannot do thatâ€”a English test each student could pass by their efforts.

I could have more than one thousand reasons to come back to China except the one called Poor English. So disappointed I am.
