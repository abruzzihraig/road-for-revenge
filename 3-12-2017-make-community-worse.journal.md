### Make Community Worse
I found a weird phenomenon when I looked through the app Zhihu. Along with a community grows, the member quality would be shitty. From v2ex, Zhihu, Bilibili to Github, each of them used to be a minority community with a group of elites. But recently I have seen many ignorant words on these platforms. I cannot express how these guys could be such arrogant and pompous as if they just want to brag online as they did nothing in their real life.

I hate these stupid Chinese guys who always ruin every community and make them be another Baidu forum. How could we ignore these guys? Can we use a kind of blacklist plugin to ban them? Especially whoever likes bragging and cheating with their ignorance and arrogance.

They are absolutely making everything worse.
