### Back To Dark Souls 2
I bought the Dark Souls 2 in PS store before the discount activity ends. I used to think the Dark Souls 2 is a failing work as one of the Dark Souls series. Unlike the first or the third generation of Dark Souls series, the second generation directed by another video game director. So that there are lots of comments said the Dark Souls 2 lacks of the original spirit of Dark Souls. And that’s why I didn’t buy it before until got the discount recently.

However, after I tried it a few hours, I found the Dark Souls 2 is better than what I expected. The instruction set is completely same as the Dark Souls 3. So I could easy and fast to pick the instructions up. As for the perspective on the game, it is better than Dark Souls 1 but duller than the third. It’s enough for my taste. Supposed that I could find more funny stuff in the game.

Tomorrow is the last day that I don’t need to work with my unfriendly colleagues. So I decide to invite my Chinese guys to have a Korean fried chicken as a celebration.
