### Type Could Be Essential
There was an idea broke out when I was taking shower tonight. That is maybe classifying everyone is essential in the society.

We used to hear that some people said do not classify anyone, because everyone is unique. I thought so before. Yes, everyone is unique for themselves, because no one wants itself normal like any other people. But, to the society, it does’t care about if anyone is unique. That’s a one of rules of the true world.

When I played my guitar and I wanted to find a way to perform music, there were so many music lovers looked same. They have similar taste on every bad thing. I cannot accept that to make myself just like them without human thinking. Most of features on the class were opposite to my belief.

After I became a programmer, I found my friends have same interests and habits. To catch them sometimes are made me tired and boring . For example, they like Japanese anime, they like playing individual games. If any one of them find a new interest thing, the rest of them almost are interested with that. I don’t know why they are always same and happy with that. To me, it feels like I am not in their class.

That made me remind an interesting thing. In the game Dark Souls 3, you can choose a kind of profession as a initialisation. There are multiple types could be chosen, a fighter, an enchanter, an assassin, or something else. There is only one profession specific is called useless man, he has average properties when initialise. Actually during the whole game, if you want to avoid being killed by enemies, you have to contribute yourself as a specific way to be an expert. If you grow averagely, or just grow with your interests, you cannot easy to live in the game world.

It just likes the true society. If you don’t contribute yourself as a specific type, you will be normal and hard to live with the true enemies within the same world.
