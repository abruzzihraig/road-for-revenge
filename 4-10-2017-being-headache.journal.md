### Being Headache
I was tired of anything happened around myself. I cannot focus on my work since the event that breaking up with my girlfriend hit me. I need more time to adapt the life without her.

There is sad news. My colleague Justin never come to the office more than two weeks, whose mother got cancer and passed away these days so that we will go to his mother’s funeral tomorrow morning. I hope he could be strong and still be happy as his mother never leave him.

It’s a sad season with the continuous rain.
