### Stress On Website Builder
The current project I am developing sucks me a lot. Its complexity goes beyond my previous imagination. Not only the parser that parses javascript, styles, and JSON templates to HTML is very hard work, the draggable feature around the deep tree is also a tremendous challenge to me. With these two parts, to implement a perfect time traveling is nearly hopeless. You shouldn’t record each of individual state to store because there are some actions they should be combined to transactions. That really hurts me.

Currently, the model structure is complicated enough. It at least has five layers: Page Template > Element Template > Column(Layout) > Rich Component > Basic Element. The Page Template can include any of other types. The Element Template can include any of other types except Page Template and itself. The Column currently only has one depth for simplifying the work, and it also can include some of Rich Components and all of the Basic Elements. For a Rich Component, it might have some behaviors by Javascript, such as Carousel, social buttons. For Basic Elements, they are designed to atomic models can be easily grouped by high-order structures. For example, Text, Post, Image, Video, Button they all belong to Basic Elements. And the Post even need to support real-time Markdown editing.

But now I am blocked by some issues that I used as underlying libraries. It’s so hard to me to make the stuff done before the four-month deadline. Anyway, hope I can get some good news after the first month ends.
