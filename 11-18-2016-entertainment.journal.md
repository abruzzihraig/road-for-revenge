### Entertainment
Watched some TV shows, played the latest game Dishonored 2. I‘ve been relaxing at the whole night. But I don’t have anything want to write today.

The Dishonored2 is not excellent like what I expected before. I even cannot stay interested in it more than one hour. I suppose maybe I don't belong to the gamers who like to play as a spy or an assassin. Maybe the DarkSouls3 and the Bloodborne raised my taste on those ACT/RPG games. I don’t have any interest in a simple game which doesn’t have any punishment when you fail or die.

No matter what I am going to enjoy the weekend. I could sleep until tomorrow afternoon.
