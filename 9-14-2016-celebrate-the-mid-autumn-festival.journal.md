### Celebrate The Mid-Autumn Festival
It is a special day. My friend Ryan invited me to his home to have dinner. Since the mid-autumn festival is approaching, so he think we should play together to celebrate it.

Ryan is actually an incredible chef, he even wanted to make some moon cakes! But it is regrettable because the flour cannot stick with water and butter. So the moon cakes were failed.

Although we didnâ€™t eat the moon cake, but Ryan still made some other dishes. Those food are pretty delicious, lamb ribs, bamboo shoot and saliva chicken were all eaten up by us. I even thought it is wasting his talent to be a developer, he should have been a chef.

After dinner, we played a board game German Heart Disease. This game needs a high attention to watch if the cards are valid on the board. If they are valid, we need grab to touch the bell as soon as possible, then the winner will get more cards, until all of cards are occupied by the winner.

The game made me nervous, and it is not easy to play. After that I nearly felt tired. I have to say I am not good at this kind of board game, maybe girls more like that.

This is my first mid-autumn festival out of China, but it still made me warm and happy. Thanks for Ryan and Yifei.
