### Board Game Burns Brain
I need to get up early tomorrow to look at the exhibition of Van Gogh. My brain is burning now as tonight the game rules of the board game Puerto Rico took me more than two hours to understand. It displays many complicated concepts in my head. Hope it could be helpful for playing it with my friends tomorrow.
