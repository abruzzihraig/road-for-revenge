### Dark Souls DLC Is Too Short
You know that I was addicted to Dark Souls again. I took a whole night to play the latest DLC Ashes of Ariandel on it.

The DLC imports some new weapons and armors for the critical feature arena. As for the drama on DLC, I have to say it is too short. There are only two bosses in the DLC world, and I only took three hours passed them.

Then I tried the new weapons in the arena with other players, and it is indeed interesting feature for the Dark Souls. We can even fight with at most eight people in the meantime. Also, I played it with my friend Chong Wang a while, but actually I just showed off my new weapons to him.

It is too late now, and I have to make the journal finished immediately because my eyes will close before I can get the bed.
