### Christmas Day Comes
Let me celebrate my first Christmas holiday. It is going to become from tomorrow. Even though I have no plan on holiday, I still feel happy with thatâ€”I do not need to see some guys during these two weeks.

My boss invited us to have a brunch this morning. We chose a Korean restaurant and ate from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. It's nearly a whole workday. We just worked less than half hours after we went back to the office, and left early.

Melbourne is Paradise! No one wants to work today. Let's enjoy life.
