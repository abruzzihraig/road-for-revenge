### “Do Me A Favor”
My girlfriend showed me a short video about a girl had a cancer. I don’t know where does she get it, but she said it is touching and it nearly made her cry. So she asked me that I have to watch it immediately.

The video only has 10 minutes. It is a TV show about performing a perfect speech. But it’s not like the TED.

The speaker is a women as one of successful people. She got a cancer on her ovary this year. She is still single, that means she will lose a possibility to be a mother if she need to cut her ovary. Even though she might fortunately keep her life after a series of surgeries.

She reviewed and reflected her past during these years. She was too busy to sleep early everyday(That’s why my girlfriend asked me to watch it). She could have done more examinations when her doctor told her there were something abnormal in her body. But she ignored the warning then worked harder than before.

After she passed out at home. A doctor said her tumor in her ovary is too large now. No one knew if it is a vicious tumor. So she had to wait for a surgery to judge.

She nearly broke down. Cause all of efforts for she wanted to seek a better life will be totally ruined by the simple word cancer. She got the cancer even though she exercises regularly all the time.

Her friends and her family around her are sad everyday. They all felt that is unfair and cruel to her. But they also knew it is to late. She was so regretful to work hard before, the hard work made her stay up late every day.

Finally, she wanted every one who was listening to her to remember nothing is important but health.

The story is ended, but my life is continued. Then the next limitation from my girlfriend to me is that I cannot sleep late anymore. Guys, please share my tears.
