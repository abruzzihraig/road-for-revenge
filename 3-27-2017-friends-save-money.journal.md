### Friends Save Money
Thanks for my ex colleague Tiny Pig. She is going to have a trip in Melbourne from the next month. She asked me tonight if I need any stuff from Beijing which she could buy them for me. That is an absolutely good news for me as the electronic products here are too expensive. Maybe that’s because Australia doesn’t produce those kinds of products.

With her help, I looked through the Chinese biggest shopping site JD a whole night. From hard drive to Macbook Magsafe adapter, I bought a bunch of hardwares that I always need but too expensive at here. It seems I will treat her a scrumptious dinner.
