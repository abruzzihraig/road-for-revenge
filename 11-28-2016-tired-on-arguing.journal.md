### Tired On Arguing
Just argued with my girlfriend two hours. She failed with her University applying. We felt so regretful on that. But she said many times to me that she want to be a tattooist. I said to her: ‘yes, you can do that, if you want to lose me.’

Fuck for those whimsical dreams when we need to be responsible for our future life in this cruel society.
