### Why To Become An Entertaining Person
I heard a tedious argument many times these two years. That is 'To be an entertaining person.' You can easily find the sentence in SNS, some people use it as theirs intro/motto.

The words sound like a shameful flag. You could find some words similar in non-mainstream period ten years before. Such as 'Forgot love' or 'Promised to be the angle for each other.' Does anyone hold the flag to be an interesting person cannot feel a little shame? I guess so. They'll find themselves stupid someday. And they will wipe the memory as some people want to wipe their childish tattoos.

I call them poser for the behavior titled themselves to be a different one than others. I don't know why they can get the sense of superiority from discriminating others. But I will accept the tedious behavior as they have their right to build their life.

I don't want to push myself to be any person or to make myself get a sense of belonging in a social circle. Life is short, and I don't want to against my heart to be a phony. I know I have few friends could chat deeply on the topic that life. That's why I really feel depressed every day. I pretend to be a happy guy for everyone, and it makes me tired after I get home.

I searched a man who named Yu Jae Seok today. He is a well-known MC in Korea. I know him because I watched Running Man many times in the past, which is hosted by him. And he always appears kind and comfortable. So I tried to learn more about him.

I nearly took one hour to know what a kind of person he is. Then I found hundreds of comments by lots of actors and singers who are active in the Korean entertainment circle. Everyone respects him in Korea. He is the only one who is thought by people that he could get 99% votes if he participates in the presidential election. Even he has already got a huge success, but he still feels distressful when he wants to buy a new car instead of the old car he used many years. He doesn't care about salary and also doesn't show up anytime. He cares about everyone nearby him and helps them get rid of predicaments. If you watched his program, you would believe he is indeed a unique person who could be loved by everyone. You cannot easy to find someone like him in your whole life.

He is my idol. There is an idiom '高山仰止' in Chinese to describe such person, which means showing great respect for a worthy man. Known what he did makes me feel shameful. I just like a normal person who is used to frame others in work and life. Too small I am comparing with him. I will learn more from this kind of person to be a better man. That is an attractive destination for me rather than just to be entertaining.

No matter what, most of the time I just want to live along and to die as soon as possible. I hate everything occurs in my life. Thought I would keep depressed during my entire life. Let me go is the best blessing to me.
