### Deny Workmates
The backend guy gave me a bunch of requirements for restructuring the final directories and filenames and external configs and so on. That not only took me a whole day for those work that shouldn’t belong to me but also pissed me off. 

You cannot imagine how stupid the requirements like. When I was doing those requirements, I even thought I am a tailor rather than an engineer. But what else can I do? Can I just put those shit to my workmate then say him doesn’t know anything about writing scripts? No, I can’t. I just took those history issues repeatedly and polluted my new code again.

Someday, I finally would find a better team to work. When that time, nobody is lazy and likes to put shitty work to other guys. Everyone there are professional and positive. We would do something fancy and excellent in the world.
