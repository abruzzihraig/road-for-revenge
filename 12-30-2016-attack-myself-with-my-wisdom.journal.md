### Attack Myself With My Wisdom
I made a masterpiece tonight.

It was almost 9 p.m. I found that my network speed was too slow to open any website. So I accessed to the admin system of my router. Then I found something shocking to me—there were two devices named Hon Hai appeared on the table which displayed all accessed clients.

That must be a Chinese guy, I guessed.

So immediately I banned him by the addresses of his devices. But it doesn't have any punishment on him, doesn't it?

I was not satisfied with the kind result. So I decided to make an ARP attack on his devices. Yes, just to be a middle man and to hijack his sessions with the server he is going to access.

For that purpose, I downloaded and compiled a bunch of programs in my MacBook Pro. At the mean time, my friend Dolphin called me to play the game Uncharted 4. After some attempts, I met a critical issue with the outdated library Driftnet, which is used for hijacking images from a network.

So I had to stop the work and went to play with my friends. Before I started the game, I changed the SSID name of my network to "SB_Hon_Hai." I assumed this guy would try to invade my network continuously. So the name "SB_Hon_Hai" would be a great gift for him.

For the sake of safety, before started the game, I locked my door.

Everything looked fine until we finished the game and I was going to close the TV. I found my TV cannot access to my network no matter what I tried. It seemed like something blocked it...wait, thought I realized something—is it one of Hon Hai?

I googled the name Hon Hai immediately, and I found Hon Hai belongs to Foxconn—one of the largest electronics industry companies. I turned my sight to my Sony TV and Sony PS4. I thought I got the whole world at that moment.

God bless my wisdom.
