### The Last Of Us Are Real Hope
There were some bad things on work made me unhappy today. The backend guys didn’t sync the public API server with the latest developing API server. They left quickly from office without any message to us.

Actually, more than half delayed tasks were blocked by the backend API. I don’t know why those guys are so irresponsible on their work. Last week we had already met the same situation, the public server was not a newest version. That took us two more hours on releasing process to prevent the side effects from the legacy API.

Never mind, they give me money and the VISA, that is the only way reliable for me to America someday. So let them go, just keeping the technical faith to myself.

For getting rid of the unpleasant memory, I played the Dark Souls 3 a whole night. It is worth mentioning that this is the third time I replayed the game. So you guys could know how much free time I have during the half year.

Since the Dark Souls 3 has already made me feel bored, so after killed two bosses I closed it immediately. I would have watched a drama to instead of. But before I switched to Netflix, there was an idea came out: why don’t try the game I bought yesterday? That is the game The Last Of Us.

I would have decided to take five minutes on it, but from the beginning of the game, I was totally involved in. The Last Of Us just likes a movie, it has extremely strong appeal. Every detail on character voices and BGM are pretty attractive. Each frame on the game could be a nice photograph. It seems a little bit similar to Uncharted 4.

However, the most impressing part to me is the story itself. I just played it less than two hours, and I am not sure if the further story is still interesting. But so far, it just seems like the drama Walking Dead to me. I enjoyed the time when I play it.

The most important thing I forget to say, tomorrow is a holiday in Melbourne, so that I could have three free days to stay at home. However, I’m not sure if I will do something insignificant on the three-day holiday. I wish I could remind  my girlfriend’s name after the holiday.
