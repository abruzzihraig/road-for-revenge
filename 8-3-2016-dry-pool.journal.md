### Dry Pool
There is always sometime you feel the inspiration dried up. I feel so today.

When the time close to evening, I found a significant article from my subscription of HackerNews. That is [How to read a book](http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf). This article has so much attention from community thus it has been third recommendation on the subscription list today. That actually made me felt a little bit astonished: why the article which just like teaching material from any primary school could be in top 3 of HackNews notification?

I don’t know why, but I guess most of hackers are more care about how to learn rather than what should be learned. They may focus on a high-level process that is learning way itself.

No matter what they think, I don’t have any motivation from it. Everyone knows I am learning English without a way to exam, I don’t want to read something only focus on how to quickly answer a few questions after it ends. So yes that made me interested.

I read the half article. It indicates a clear argument: your time is limited in the real world, you need to control your reading strategy and time to make you get high information more effectively.

And It is indeed has some meaningful viewpoints that I have never seen before. The most fascinating part I was learned is that you should figure out the background of the author whose books you are going to read on. In that way you can analyse which part of his/her books is intellectual context. Reading book dialectically then you won’t following all of arguments from an author, so you can prevent some of meaningless parts with prejudices, blind spots, desperate moments or desires from their books.

Good night with the best soft drink in Australia:
