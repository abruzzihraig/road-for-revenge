### DQ Builder
I didn’t work at home as the past few days because I felt my brain had burnt too much. So I bought a new game DQ builder for relaxing myself. It has half discount in recent activity, so I thought that was a good time to buy. After a few hours had played the game, I could basically confirm it was a right decision to buy it.

Most of the time when playing the DQ builder I was just building my small town. I like the background music around there that really makes me relaxed. On the other hand, there are all kinds of RPG tasks to make me easy to go forward in this large open-world game. I have to say this is the only game that makes me comfortable. There’s nothing gives me any stress in it. That is an incredible experience. Especially when you just went through hard work.

Now I’m ready to take a shower, then go bed to sleep.
