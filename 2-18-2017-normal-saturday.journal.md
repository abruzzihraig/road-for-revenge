### Normal Saturday
It’s just a normal Saturday as before. I played the game Ni-oh in the afternoon and watched some videos tonight. There is nothing worth to record just like water flow. Will buy some food tomorrow especially the eggs which every time I went to market and found them were sold out. But It finally depends on tomorrow’s weather on whether I will go out for life.
