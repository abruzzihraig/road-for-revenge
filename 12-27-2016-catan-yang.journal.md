### Catan Yang
I was invited to my friend Ryan's home tonight. I took a board game Catan to his home to play after dinner.

Catan is the board game which I am really familiar. I can still remember its rules even though I haven't played it more than one year. It's also the first genuine board game I bought. I can pay less than 20% of the genuine board game in China, why not choose piracy? Since I have already in Australia, Surly I should buy a genuine one.

The genuine Catan has an elegant box with a few grooves which have different shapes could be filled with those cards and props. When you put the cards together on your table, you will get a smooth and flat map. But in piracy, you will be bothered with the rugged map.

I used to call myself Catan Yang because I always win the most rounds of Catan I played in the past. I don't know why but the result indeed indicates that I have high winning percentage on this game, I guess that might be 80 percent or higher. Just like there is a God of Catan always protects me when I develop my territory.

Just like what I said that I have high winning percentage on this game. We played two rounds tonight, and each round might take 90 minutes. Even though I suffered many obstructions, finally I won all of them. And the result protected the title again.

I have to say play board games are the best way to make friends closer. I will buy another famous strategy board game "Puerto Rico" when it is in store.
