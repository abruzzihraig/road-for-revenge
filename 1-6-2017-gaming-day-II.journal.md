### Gaming  Day II
It’s just a normal gaming day again. Since I bought a bunch of games from the discount activity yesterday, so I tried them one by one until night. But there is a game which makes me disappointed—the Darksider 2. I can’t believe the game only has 30 fps on PS4. So poor performance when the frames motion.

It’s time to sleep, and I need to go outside to buy some gifts for my Chinese friends and families tomorrow.
