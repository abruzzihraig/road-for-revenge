### MobX Likes To Confuse You
I finally finished reading the document of MobX. To figure out the part ‘createTransform’ took me much time. I don’t like the way the author writes. Sometimes it uses vague and abstract words to summarize an important concept. There must be clearer examples or sentences to elaborate those concepts we might never meet before.

You can even found some sentences like ‘This can be used to transform an observable data graph into an another observable data graph, which can be used to transform... you get the idea.’ Oh, what kind of idea can I get? I am not a genius, and I am just a learner as a newbie of MobX. The document sucks me all the time, but I have to say it is an excellent solution for state management.

I may need to do some practices for getting what some concepts do actually mean.
