### Les Fleurs du mal
It’s just a normal Saturday. I learned a few hours today but I also find some interesting stuff. That is a manga that called “Les Fleurs du mal”.

It is absolutely incredible artwork. Even though it describes a love story within puberty. I continuously watched it more than six hours. I am totally involved in it. If you guys feel boring recently, I highly recommend you to watch the manga. You will be attracted and shocked by it.

No more time to record today, so let me free on my bed.
