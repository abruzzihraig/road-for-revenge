### Mysterious Guy
Since I worked here there is always a guy everyday I can see in the park, in witch I have to get through to my office.

The guy seems mysterious. He always sits on the same bench which back to road. No matter how strong wind, no matter how dense cloud, every morning when I walk nearby the beach, I always could see the guy’s back, the guy’s hat and the guy’s hands are rubbing.

He always looks like a man who is thinking, he doesn’t care about anyone through the road, just shows them his back and his indifferent style.

Sometimes he read some books on the bench, if felt cold he would rub his hands constantly. In some other time, I also noticed he brought some weird musical instruments. Fiddled with these instruments but I am sure he didn’t play them. He used a microphone on a stand to record the timbre from his instruments. No one actually knew what he was doing, but I suppose he was enjoyable.

Actually I have a little bit admire this guy. Lives like a kind of artist, even though he might have nothing to proud, even though nobody knows him. At least he knows what he have done and what he is doing. Don’t care about other people’s mind, then enjoy the relaxing life.
