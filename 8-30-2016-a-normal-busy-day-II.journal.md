### A Normal Busy Day II
Just like yesterday, busy and tired, I was coding until now(2:20 AM).

I have nothing to say today, and I just want to sleep now. Hope the project process could be controlled. Tomorrow, I need make a whole month plan for the project too. Because no one knows how we made efforts these days.

Ignore todayâ€™s journal, Give me some time to take a bath. Thanks.
