### Strict Days
I have to sleep early today because our clients from Japan are going to work with us this week. Our boss wants us to go to office early everyday in this week and also off work late. As well as I need to take a shower tomorrow morning so I have to get up before than 8:30 a.m.

Hope our client Softbank could give us more investment so that I could apply more salary.
