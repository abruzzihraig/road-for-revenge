### Guilt For Luxurious Stuff
I was playing games a whole day in my new HDR TV. The HDR is amazing technology which will make black be more black and white be more white. You even can see each hair in games by Naughty Dogs.

Even though I got those luxurious devices and I really enjoy them, actually I know I am blameful. Look around my cozy home, you will find nothing in there is essential for my personal life. I don’t need them, and I also don’t have so much time to spend on each expensive stuff that I bought. I shouldn’t bought them but I have already did that. That makes me felt guilty for both myself and my girlfriend. So I promised to her that I won’t buy any useless fancy stuff before she comes in the next year.

I repent those my stupid behaviours in this half year. And I really wish I could do something significant to reduce my guilt.
