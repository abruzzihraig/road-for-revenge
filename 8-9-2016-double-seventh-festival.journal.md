### Double Seventh Festival
How strong windy today! I was going to take my girlfriend shopping today, for celebrating the festival Double Seventh. However it was so regretful, the strong wind saved my wallet.

For the festival, I got off work early today, maybe after half past four pm. I had already at home.

Honestly I just wanted to get more time to play Dark Souls these days, but I supposed if I played the game just after work, without company to my girlfriend, I will take more time to coax her at a whole night.

So I decided to cook for her today. Unfortunately I just can cook a few dishes, and I actually don’t have enough experience to make them better. Finally my pitiful girlfriend had to eat something simple and easy to cook: first is fired rice with eggs and hams, second is beef with chilli. Yes the both are my best dishes.

Fired rice was nice thus nothing to criticise, it should be perfect I suppose. As for the beef with chilli, I forgot the right order to cook them separately. So I had to fire them three times while it still tasted tasteless even though I had already put so much salt. For saving it, I also put lots of peppers on it. Hoped my girlfriend could excuse my poor cooking skill.

If some food cooked by yourself, even though they taste bad, you will eat them up. Might that’s why home cooking is better than outsider.
