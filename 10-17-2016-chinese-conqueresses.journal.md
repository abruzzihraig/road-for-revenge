### Chinese Conqueresses
I've already tried to learn something about Sketch. I read some articles tonight, but I am still confused with each corner on the panel of Sketch. I even feel it only works for smartphones or tablets. There is few resource about web design on Sketch tutorials.

Even though I had nothing improved on my path to learning design, I got some shocking views about Chinese girls on a business called overseas purchasing. It was an absolute nightmare.

My nephew was born five months ago, so my sister wants me to buy some milk powder and baby food for her son. Everyone in China knows that milk powder in there is unsafe because too many businesses in China are totally conscienceless. And Australia is one of a major exporter of agriculture. So the milk powder in Australia is attractive to Chinese.

You can't believe every corner of this city must have a Chinese delivery store. One box can be filled with three cans of milk powder. That is an unspoken rule for each Chinese student here. Especially a bunch of girls. No one knows how much tax they have evaded. According to an investigation by the government, the estimated value is one hundred million per year.

It doesn't matter to me I thought then. I just wanted to buy a few cans of milk powder, a few bottles of Calcium, and a few bags of baby rice.

However, I was utterly failed. I figured out nothing except two bottles of fish oil in the two of largest chemist's shops here. All of what I wanted to buy were out of stock. The only valuable stuff on the empty shelf was its price tag. How can I get them from the Chinese hands?

Yes, the answer is to buy them from a Chinese shop.

Finally, I got everything from a Chinese overseas purchasing store. And they even provide a service to deliver the packages to China. They got the victory, but I got the sweat.

What the fuck today, it took me nearly three hours to search that essential stuff of life, then the result is I have to pay the money back to Chinese. Holy ironic.
