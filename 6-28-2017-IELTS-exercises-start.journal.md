### IELTS Exercises Start
I cannot write much as it is too late. I have been getting start to prepare IELTS test for the PR application in the next year. I did some Listening exercises and backed words tonight. Everything seems fine and I want to keep it with a light way, then gradually enhance its intensity. But now, I have to sleep as soon as possible.
