### Saturday Renew
It’s a relaxing Saturday. I cooked and cleaned, but felt boring all the time. I can’t help to light up my mobile to see if there is any new message from my friends, but always get nothing from it. For preventing from this lonesome feeling, I took a shower and shaved my messy beard and wore contact lenses to go out for shopping. And finally, I got a stack of snacks and drinks from Asian market. So I proved that saying–food can let you get rid of upset.
