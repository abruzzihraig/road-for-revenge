### Cut My Hands Off
There are some exciting products are releasing recently. They produced by Microsoft, PlayStation, and Apple. All those products are expensive and attractive to me. I am not sure if I can ignore them and save money for the Chinese New Year.

As we all know, PlayStasion has been releasing their killer product PS VR a few weeks. I have already ordered one in mid-September. And the good news I received today is that a shipment of PS VR just arrived in the EB Games' warehouse, so that I could get it these days. At the mean time, I have to pay the rest of amount except the deposit I've already paid.

Yesterday, Microsoft made a product launch. The shiniest product for me is the Surface Studio. It has a 28-inch pixel sensed touchscreen display, and it even surpasses current 4K displays. There is also a new stuff as a tool on the screen. It called Surface Dial. If you never see it before, trust me you will feel shocked with that. I think it should be the best accessibility for designers. You can use it on the screen to zoom your artwork or pick a color from the color palette which calculated by the particular environment.

If I am a designer, I will take all money to buy it. Fortunately, I am not.

And for the later today, there will be another big cheese that Apple will upgrade their key product MacBook. I have been waiting for it more than three years. These years they didn't update anything except some foundational hardware, such as CPU or Memories. But it doesn't impress me, and I have no reason to update my device.

As the latest rumors, they media said that the new MacBook has a line of LED keyboard. It's awesome, doesn't it? However, It might be amazing for you rather than me. Because I am a VIM user, but It unexpectedly doesn't have an ESCAPE key on the new keyboard. How can I use a virtual key to code? Oh, my sky will be full of haze, and we VIM guys don't know where should we go.

Summing up all the information in one sentence is that take my money and shut up.
