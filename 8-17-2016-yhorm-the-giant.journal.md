### Yhorm The Giant
What an exciting tonight! I killed the boss Yhorm of Dark Souls 3 just now. No one knows what a nervous experience I had.

The first time I started opening the Yhorm’s door, I noticed Onion Knight is not in there. That made me realised maybe I lost something important within extension storys. So I had to be killed by Yhorm. I was so heart-broken, because I left more than 40,000 souls in there. That means if I want to pick them up, I have to walk to anywhere without using bonfire to quickly transfer.

By searching some useful gaming strategies of Dark Souls 3, I finally found that I forgot to save Onion Knight out of prison. So I have to kill every enemy with a great care to get the prison.

Onion Knight is a fat man sit on the floor in prison. Through into a window, he told me that I need to find a key first. Actually I had already got the key then, but I don’t know where is the door to use the key.

At that time, I was lost in the complex map again. Since I cared about those souls left nearby Yhorm, I had to kill anyone on my way. I nearly killed all of enemies in the whole underground prison! That takes me so much time because I have to be careful when fighting with them. If I died, all of souls would be lost. Besides, I also need save my limited blood bottles.

Finally I found the secret road to get the door of Onion Knight’s room. Onion Knight gave me a best stone to enhance my sword after I unlocked the door.

After that, I started to fight Yhorm again. But I was so careless at this time. When I walked to the Yhorm’s room, I didn’t equip the sword Storm, which is efficient to kill Yhorm. So I had to let Onion Knight facing Yhorm alone, but I was trying to find and equip the sword Storm.

However, even though I was trying my best to equip the Storm fast, Onion Knight still died. I picked up the souls, with addition of new income, it reached to 100,000 souls. After received a few attacks, I was died due to I didn’t have enough supply.

What a sad story! I have to do the same thing again! But Onion Knight has been dead.

Fine, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm. Because I didn’t know how to use a specific skill of the sword Storm, I didn’t know which button should I press.

Never mind, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. Again, I was killed by Yhorm, again. Even if he just left the final blow to be died. I nearly screamed then.

I need a little lucky, for the 100,000 souls. I do it. At this time, the worst situation was appeared. I can’t believe that I was died by coming down from a bridge. That means I lost all of souls near the Yhorm.

With a sad breast, I tried it again. This time I finally killed Yhorm, just with few bottles of supply. But so what? I have already lost 100,000 souls and so much time tonight. My mood has already been unhappy. Even though the game is actually exciting, but it was not satisfied me indeed tonight.
