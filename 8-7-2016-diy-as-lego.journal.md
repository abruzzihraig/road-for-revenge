### DIY as LEGO
What a tired day! We have been shopping on IKEA a whole day. By the tram 109, way to eastward, it took half hour we finally got there.

The IKEA in Melbourne is smaller then in Beijing. But actually most of goods are same, you can find words ‘MADE IN CHINA’ anywhere. Also you can find some familiar Chinese words on lots of packages.

We like to buy something which can actually improve our life style. And thanks to IKEA, for its price and consistency on design. I found so many baubles and convenient stuffs which  could satisfy me, especially those goods which could make home more warm. For example, scented candle could make you relax, floor lamp with my wooden desk would be harmony and neat, small storage boxes could take advantage of any narrow space around my bed.

Yes I like the feeling that anything could use all of space exactly, but still keeping consistency visually. I can finally put my iPhone or iPad or something else like remote controls to those storage boxes around my bed. I can’t believe how I could stand them drop down to floor through a narrow gap between bed and wall again and again. Do you know what is the worst thing when I get up? It’s just when I want to close my alarm but accidentally my phone dropped down through the gap. Oh my glasses as well. The terrible scene will destroy my mood in the morning. I’d rather than buy some useful stuffs to avoid this scene.

Sure, the most difficult part is compose those complex furniture, such as cabinet or desk. Yes I spent an hour more again to DIY those complex stuffs. For me it just like to build LEGO but it might make your finger pain. My girlfriend always call me repairman, that’s not without reason.

Tired but happy, hope my environment could be more cosy.
