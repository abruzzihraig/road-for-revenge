### Kidney Pain
Apple threw out a bomb at the yesterday midnight. It exploded and shocked me this morning. The WWDC of Apple nearly upgraded its all mainstreamed products except iPhone. I was so excited that I couldn’t help to pick up a new MacBook from Apple store.

The new iMac Pro is amazing, but the basic version its price is high up to 6500 AUS dollars, I can only buy one by my current saving. But that doesn’t mean MacBook would be cheap in this upgrading. The version that I prefer to buy needs 4099 AUS dollars. Do they want to rob our normal users? But the high price is always not an issue made by Apple. The good stuff needs taking money or time. Without the either one equivalent, you cannot get the best products.

I decide to buy the new MacBook in the next financial year(after this month) so that I can get some tax returns in the next year.

To Apple: Shut up and take my money.
